Okay, let's analyze the commentary snippets for Player23.

Based on the instructions, I need to extract the player name, initialize the counts for all events to zero, and then iterate through each commentary snippet, incrementing the counts only when the target player is explicitly and unambiguously attributed to the event.

*   **Player Name:** Player23

Now, let's process the commentary snippets:

*   Snippet 1: "Player23(Away Team) earns a free kick in the opponent's half."
    *   This snippet explicitly states that Player23 earns a free kick. Thus, Free Kicks count is incremented by 1.

Now, create the final summary table:
