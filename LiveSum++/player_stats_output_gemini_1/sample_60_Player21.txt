Analyzing the snippets for Player21:

- "Player21(Away Team) attempts a through ball, but Player29(Away Team) is offside for the Away Team." -> No countable event because while Player21 attempted a through ball, the offside was committed by Player29, not Player21.
- "Player21(Away Team) commits a foul." -> Counts as 1 Foul because the snippet explicitly states Player21 committed a foul.
