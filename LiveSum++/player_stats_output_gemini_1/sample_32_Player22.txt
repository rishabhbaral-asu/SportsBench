Analyzing the snippets for Player22:

- "Player22(Away Team) attempts a through ball, but Player27(Away Team) is offside for the Away Team." -> No countable event because the snippet mentions Player22 attempting a through ball but Player27 is offside; it does not state that Player22 is offside.
- "Player22(Away Team)'s left footed shot from outside the box is blocked, resulting in a free kick for Player22(Away Team) in the attacking half." -> Counts as 1 Shot and 1 Free Kick because the snippet explicitly states Player22 took a shot which was blocked, and a free kick results for Player22.
