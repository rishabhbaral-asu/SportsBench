Analyzing the snippets for Player28:
- "Player28(Away Team)'s shot from the center of the box is blocked with the help of Player27(Away Team)." -> Counts as 1 Shot because the snippet explicitly states Player28 took a shot.
- "Player28(Away Team) attempts a through ball, but Player29(Away Team) is offside for the Away Team." -> No countable event because although Player28 attempts a through ball, the statement highlights that Player29 is offside and this does not have an impact on Player28's statistics.
