Okay, I'm ready to process the soccer commentary snippets and generate the player statistics table.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player22.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

*   Shots: 0
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player22(Away Team)'s header from the center of the box is saved in the top center of the goal with an assist from Player24(Away Team)."
    *   This snippet mentions a "header" by Player22 that was "saved". This implies a shot attempt on goal. Therefore, increment Shots by 1.
    *   The snippet explicitly says the Player22's header was saved, meaning no goals were scored. Goal count remains 0.
    *   The snippet also mentions "assist from Player24," which means Player22 did not provide an assist, therefore assists count remains at 0.
*   **Snippet 2:** "Player22(Away Team) commits a foul."
    *   This snippet clearly states that Player22 committed a foul. Increment Fouls by 1.

**4. Final Counts:**

*   Shots: 1
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 1
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

**5. Final Summary Table:**
