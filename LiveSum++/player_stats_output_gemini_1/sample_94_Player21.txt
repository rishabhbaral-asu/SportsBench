Analyzing the snippets for Player21:
- "Player21(Away Team) of the Away Team attempts a through ball to Player28(Away Team), but he is caught offside, Player9(Home Team) takes a left-footed shot from the center of the box, but it is saved by the goalkeeper, with an assist from Player10(Home Team)." -> No countable event because while Player21 attempts a through ball to Player28 who is offside, there is no explicit mention of an assist by Player21 or Player21 being offside.
