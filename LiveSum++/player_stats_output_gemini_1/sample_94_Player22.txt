Analyzing the snippets for Player22:
- "Player22(Away Team) attempts a through ball, but Player27(Away Team) is offside for the Away Team." -> No countable event because Player22 attempted a pass, but Player27 was the player in an offside position, and not Player22.
- "Player22(Away Team)'s shot from close range is saved by the goalkeeper after being set up by Player25(Away Team)." -> Counts as 1 Shot because the snippet explicitly states Player22's shot was saved.
