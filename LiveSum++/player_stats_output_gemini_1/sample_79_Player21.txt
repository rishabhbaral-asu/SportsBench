Analyzing the snippets for Player21:
- "Player21(Away Team)'s attempt from outside the box with his left foot on a direct free kick just missed high." -> Counts as 1 Shot and 1 Free Kick because the snippet explicitly states Player21 took an attempt on goal from a direct free kick.
- "Player21(Away Team) attempts a through pass, but Player27(Away Team) is offside for the Away Team." -> No countable event because Player27 is offside, not Player21.
