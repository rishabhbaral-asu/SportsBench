- "Player21(Away Team)'s attempt from outside the box with his left foot on a direct free kick just missed high." -> Counts as 1 Shot and 1 Free Kick because the snippet explicitly states Player21 attempted a shot from a direct free kick.
- "Player21(Away Team) attempts a through pass, but Player27(Away Team) is offside for the Away Team." -> No event counted because the offside is for Player27, not Player21.
