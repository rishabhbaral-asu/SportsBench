    "1.  Identify the target player name from `<PLAYER_NAME>`.\n",
    "2.  Initialize counts for the following player-specific events to 0: Shots, Goals, Assists, Free Kicks (taken), Fouls (committed), Yellow Cards, Red Cards, Offsides.\n",
    "3.  Analyze each snippet within `<PLAYER_COMMENTARY_SNIPPETS>`.\n",
    "4.  **Absolute Strict Counting & Unambiguous Attribution:**\n",
    "    * Events are counted **ONLY** if they are **EXPLICITLY** stated and **UNAMBIGUOUSLY ATTRIBUTED** to the player named in `<PLAYER_NAME>` within the snippet.\n",
    "    * **NEVER** infer, guess, or hallucinate events. If the snippet does not *clearly* state the target player performed the action, do not count it.\n",
    "    * If the snippet mentions an action performed by a *different* player, or if the actor is *unclear* or *implied* but not explicitly the target player, **DO NOT COUNT** that action for the target player.\n",
    "5.  Increment counts based on the following event definitions and keywords when attributed to the target player. Apply the **Absolute Strict Counting & Unambiguous Attribution** rule (Point 4) to every potential increment.\n",
    "    * **Important Note on Combined Events:** If a single snippet describes multiple distinct events attributed to the player (e.g., committing a foul *and* receiving a yellow card for it), increment the count for *each* explicitly mentioned event.\n",
    "    * **Free Kicks (Taken):** Player is mentioned as taking or attempting a free kick or penalty kick, **OR** the player is explicitly mentioned as being fouled or winning a free kick/penalty as a result of an opponent's action. **Crucially: Any explicit mention of the player taking a penalty kick or scoring from the penalty spot COUNTS as a Free Kick (Taken). **Keywords: `[free kick, penalty, takes the kick, takes the penalty, fouled by, wins a free kick, wins a penalty, brought down by, tripped by, earns a free kick]`\n",
    "    * **Free Kicks:** If the Player is mentioned conceding a free kick or penalty, that does not count as a free kick but rather counts as a foul.\n",
    "    * **Fouls (Committed):** Count only when the commentary explicitly states the target player committed a foul or an action considered a foul. This includes, but is not limited to: dangerous play, rough tackles, reckless challenges, handling the ball (as the offender), or actions leading to disciplinary cards for aggression/misconduct like getting into a fight or confrontation. **ENSURE** the target player is the clear actor. Keywords: `[foul, dangerous play, penalty (if context explicitly implies committed by the player), rough tackle, reckless challenge, hand ball (committed), handling (committed), challenges (when describing a committed foul), fight (committed by the player), confrontation (initiated/committed by the player)]`\n",
    "    * **Yellow Cards:** Player is explicitly mentioned receiving a yellow card. Keywords: `[yellow card, booked, caution]`\n",
    "    * **Red Cards:** Player is explicitly mentioned receiving a red card. Keywords: `[red card, second yellow card, sent off]`\n",
    "    * **Shots:** Player is explicitly mentioned taking any attempt on goal (on or off target, saved, blocked, hitting woodwork, scoring). Keywords: `[hits the bar, shot, saved, missed, header (ONLY if explicitly an attempt on goal by the target player), goes high, goal, blocked, post, attempt]`\n",
    "    * **Goals:** Player is explicitly mentioned scoring a goal. Keywords: `[goal, scores]`. **Note:** Scoring a goal counts as *both* a 'Goal' and a 'Shot'.\n",
    "    * **Assists:** Count an assist **ONLY** when the commentary explicitly states the target player provided a pass or action that **directly led** to a goal. **The target player must be the one *giving* the assist, never the receiver.** Keywords: `[assist (provided by target player), assisted by (when this phrase clearly links the assist *to* the target player), assistance (provided by the target player), sets up (a goal for another player), pass leads to goal (from the target player)]` **Absolutely NO assist is counted for the target player if the snippet indicates they were *assisted by* someone else.** Example: If the snippet is \"Goal scored by Player4, assisted by Player7\" and your target is Player4, this counts as a Goal (and Shot) for Player4, but **ZERO assists** for Player4. If Player7 is the target, it counts 1 assist for Player7.\n",
    "    * **Offsides:** Player is explicitly mentioned being in an offside position. Keywords: `[offside]`\n",
    "    * **Yellow Cards:** If a reason is mentioned for the yellow card being provided, that reason should add a count to the fouls committed by the player. Example: \"Player4 received a yellow card for a foul\" counts as 1 yellow card and 1 foul for Player4.\n",
    "    * **Yellow Cards:** If a player receives a yellow card, but no reason is mentioned, then it should be counted as a yellow card only. Example: \"Player4 received a yellow card\" counts as 1 yellow card for Player4.\n",
    "    * **Red Cards:** If a reason is mentioned for the red card being provided, that reason should add a count to the fouls committed by the player. Example: \"Player4 received a red card for a foul\" counts as 1 red card and 1 foul for Player4.\n",
    "    * **Follow these statements exactly** as they are provided. Do not add any additional context or information. Your task is to extract and count the events strictly based on the provided definitions and keywords.\n",
