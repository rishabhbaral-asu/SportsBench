Objective
You are an expert in converting unstructured soccer game statements into structured updates. You have a list of atomic statements and a table schema with specified row headers (e.g., "Home Team", "Away Team") and column headers (e.g., "Free Kicks", "Fouls", etc.).

Instructions

Read each soccer statement in the given list.
Identify which row(s) and which column(s) need to be updated for each statement.
Determine the exact change for each relevant cell (for example, +1 for a foul, +1 for a free kick, etc.).
Display the revised state of all cells that changed immediately after each statement.
Output Format

For each statement, format your output as follows and return 4 lines:

statement number: 1,2,3,..... 
Statement: <actual soccer statement here>
Updates: <list of updates, e.g., "Home Team Fouls +1, Away Team Free Kicks +1">
Revised State: <list of revised cell values, e.g., "Home Team Fouls: 2, Away Team Free Kicks: 3">


This consistent pattern allows you to use regex patterns to extract the "Updates" and "Revised State" sections for each statement. Ensure that each statement block follows this exact structure.
Illustrative Examples with Five Statements

1.
Statement: Player26 (Away Team) earns a free kick in their defensive half as Player7 (Home Team) commits a foul.
Updates: Away Team Free Kicks +1, Home Team Fouls +1
Revised State: Away Team Free Kicks: 1, Home Team Fouls: 1

2.
Statement: Player7 (Home Team) receives a yellow card for a rough tackle.
Updates: Home Team Yellow Cards +1
Revised State: Home Team Yellow Cards: 1

3.
Statement: The Away Team earns a corner kick.
Updates: Away Team Corner Kicks +1
Revised State: Away Team Corner Kicks: 1

4.
Statement: Player27 (Away Team) shoots from the center of the box, scoring the first goal for his team.
Updates: Away Team Shots +1, Away Team Goals +1
Revised State: Away Team Shots: 1, Away Team Goals: 1

5.
Statement: Player 9 (Home Team) commits a foul resulting in Player26 (Away Team) earning a free kick.
Updates: Home Team Fouls +1, Away Team Free Kicks +1
Revised State: Home Team Fouls: 2, Away Team Free Kicks: 2


Important Details
Goals, saved attempts, blocked attempts, and missed attempts all count as “Shots.”
Handballs and dangerous play count as “Fouls.”
A second yellow card is effectively a red card (though it may not appear in the example).
Do not remove or add columns/rows unless specifically instructed.
