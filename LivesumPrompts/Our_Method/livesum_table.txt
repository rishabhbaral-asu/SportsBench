You are an expert in converting unstructured text into structured tables.

TASK: Generate tables that accurately represent all information using the given set of atomic statements and headers.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Resolving Ambiguity: Infer the type of data and it's context to resolve any ambiguity.  
Understand Headers: 
Row and Column Headers: Identify and comprehend the row and column headers from the given JSON dictionary. The row headers correspond to the rows of the table and the column headers correspond to the columns of the table.
Understanding Statements: The atomic statements are in an orderly sequence. i.e. nth statement would occur after (n-1)th statement.
Construct Tables: 
Iterative Updates: Process the atomic statements sequentially, and then update the table step by step. 
Missing Values: If a particular column value for a row is not present in the statements, set it to "Not found".

Ensure Structural Integrity:
Equal Cells: Each row, including headers, must have an equal number of cells.
Completeness: Include all relevant information from the input without omissions.
Consistent Formatting: Maintain uniform data formats across the table.
Table Update: Ensure that the updates takes place sequentially. Update the values, do not append the values.
Structure: Do not change any row or column headers. Do not append any extra headers.
Do not add any extra rows or columns that cannot be inferred from the the data.
Prune Empty Rows and Columns: Remove any rows or columns that do not contain data to enhance clarity.

Formatting Guidelines:
Cell Separation: Use the pipe symbol `|` to separate cells.
Row Separation: Use `<NEWLINE>` to separate lines.
Multiple Tables: If needed, separate tables with `<TABLE END>`

Final Output Requirements:
Maintain structural integrity with each table having rows matching the headers precisely.
Ensure data consistency by placing information under the correct columns.
Include all relevant data from the input statements without omissions.
Properly format cells with | and separate rows with <NEWLINE>.
The output should be a static value table.

Output Format:
|  | <COLUMN HEADER 1> | <COLUMN HEADER 2> | ...
| <ROW HEADER 1> | ...
| <ROW HEADER 2> | ...

Return only the formatted tables without any reasoning, commentary, or additional text.
