      "    *   Balls faced by each batsman\n",

      "2.  **Parse Commentary:**  I'll iterate through each line of the commentary. For each line, I'll identify:\n",
      "    *   **Batsman:** The batsman involved in the action.\n",
      "    *   **Bowler:** The bowler involved in the action.\n",
      "    *   **Runs:** The runs scored (0, 1, 2, 4, 6).\n",
      "    *   **Dismissal:** If a batsman gets out, record the dismissal type, bowler, and fielder.\n",
      "    *   **Balls Faced:** Increment the balls faced for the relevant batsman.\n",
      "    *   **Balls Bowled:** Increment the balls bowled for the relevant bowler.\n",
      "3.  **Update Stats:**  I'll update the dictionaries with the extracted information. This includes:\n",
      "    *   Adding new batsmen/bowlers if they aren't already in the dictionary.\n",
      "    *   Incrementing runs, balls faced, fours, sixes, etc.\n",
      "4.  **Calculate Strike Rate:** Calculate strike rate for each batsman.\n",
      "5.  **Calculate Overs and Maidens:** Calculate the overs bowled for each bowler.\n",
      "6.  **Convert to JSON:**  Finally, I will convert the dictionaries into the required JSON format.\n",

I'll use a combination of pattern matching and keyword recognition. I will keep track of each batsman's score and balls faced, along with fours and sixes. I will also note the mode of dismissal. For the bowlers, I will accumulate the number of balls bowled, runs given, and wickets taken. I will also track overs and maidens (though maidens are difficult to ascertain perfectly without knowing the exact score at the start of each over; I will estimate based on consecutive scoreless deliveries at the start of an over).\n",
