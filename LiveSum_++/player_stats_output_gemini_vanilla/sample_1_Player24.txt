Okay, I will follow the instructions meticulously to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the final summary table.

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player24.

        *   This snippet explicitly states Player24 committed a foul.
        *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 1

    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player24(Away Team) commits a foul, resulting in Player9(Home Team) being awarded a free kick in the attacking half, This leads to a set-piece opportunity for Player9(Home Team)'s team."
        *   This snippet explicitly states Player24 committed a foul.
