Okay, let's analyze the commentary snippets for Player4 and compile the statistics.

**Step 1: Identify the target player**

The target player is Player4.

**Step 2: Initialize counts**

*   Shots = 0
*   Goals = 0
*   Assists = 0
*   Free Kicks = 0
*   Fouls = 0
*   Yellow Cards = 0
*   Red Cards = 0
*   Offsides = 0

**Step 3: Analyze each snippet**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player4(Home Team) misses the goal with a left-footed shot from outside the box after a set piece."
    *   The snippet explicitly mentions "Player4" missing a shot. Thus, Shots += 1. Since it's a miss, Goals does not increment. Free Kick does not increment as it mentions the shot occurred "after a set piece."
*   **Snippet 2:** "Player4(Home Team) commits a foul."
    *   The snippet explicitly mentions "Player4" committing a foul. Thus, Fouls += 1.

**Step 4: Final Counts**

*   Shots = 1
*   Goals = 0
*   Assists = 0
*   Free Kicks = 0
*   Fouls = 1
*   Yellow Cards = 0
*   Red Cards = 0
*   Offsides = 0

**Step 5: Create the Final Summary Table**
