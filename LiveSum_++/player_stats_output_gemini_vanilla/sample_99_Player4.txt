Okay, let's break down the task. I need to extract the player name, analyze the commentary snippets, and count specific events related to that player, following strict rules for attribution and counting.

**1. Extract Player Name:**
The player name is Player4.

**2. Initialize Counts:**
Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   **Snippet 1: Player4(Home Team)'s shot from outside the box is blocked.**
    *   The snippet explicitly states "shot" attributed to Player4.
    *   Increment Shots: Shots = 1

*   **Snippet 2: Player4(Home Team) earns a free kick in their own half.**
    *   The snippet explicitly states "earns a free kick" attributed to Player4.
    *   Increment Free Kicks: Free Kicks = 1

*   **Snippet 3: Player4(Home Team) scores from the penalty spot with a right-footed shot into the bottom right corner.**
    *   The snippet explicitly states "scores" attributed to Player4.
    *   Increment Goals: Goals = 1
    *   Increment Shots: Shots = 2
    *   The snippet explicitly states "penalty spot" so that counts as a Free Kick.
    *   Increment Free Kicks: Free Kicks = 2

**4. Final Counts:**
Shots = 2, Goals = 1, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 2, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player4 | 2     | 1     | 0       | 2          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
