Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for Player1 and generate the final summary table.

**Objective:** Analyze commentary snippets for a specific player and count explicit occurrences of defined events for that player.

**Input:**
* **Player Name:** The name of the single player to track.
    <PLAYER_NAME>
    Player1
    </PLAYER_NAME>
* **Commentary Snippets:** A list of commentary text snippets potentially mentioning the player.
    <PLAYER_COMMENTARY_SNIPPETS>
    - Player1(Home Team) attempts a pass to Player34(Away Team), but Player9(Home Team) is flagged for being offside.
    </PLAYER_COMMENTARY_SNIPPETS>

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player1.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Analyze Snippets:**
    *   Snippet 1: "Player1(Home Team) attempts a pass to Player34(Away Team), but Player9(Home Team) is flagged for being offside."
        *   This snippet mentions Player1 attempting a pass, but it does not explicitly state that this pass led to a goal. Also, Player1 is not flagged offside himself. Thus, Assists = 0, Offsides = 0. No shots, goals, free kicks, fouls, yellow cards, or red cards are mentioned.

**Final Summary Table:**

```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player1 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
