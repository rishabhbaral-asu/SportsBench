Okay, let's start by identifying the target player.

*   **Player Name:** Player3

Now, let's initialize the event counts for Player3 to 0.

*   Shots = 0
*   Goals = 0
*   Assists = 0
*   Free Kicks = 0
*   Fouls = 0
*   Yellow Cards = 0
*   Red Cards = 0
*   Offsides = 0

Next, we will analyze the provided commentary snippets.

**Commentary Snippet 1:** "Player3(Home Team) is currently sidelined due to an injury, causing a delay in the match."

*   This snippet does not mention any of the defined events (Shots, Goals, Assists, Free Kicks, Fouls, Yellow Cards, Red Cards, or Offsides) performed by Player3. It only states that Player3 is injured. Therefore, all counts remain at 0.

Now, let's compile the final summary table.
