Okay, I will analyze the commentary snippets for Player7 and compile the statistics according to the instructions.

**Player Name:** Player7

**Commentary Snippets:**

*   Player7(Home Team) earns a free kick on the right side of the field.
*   Player7(Home Team) receives a yellow card for a rough tackle.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Free Kicks:** The first snippet states "Player7(Home Team) earns a free kick on the right side of the field." - This explicitly mentions Player7 earning a free kick. Therefore, Free Kicks is incremented by 1.
2.  **Yellow Cards:** The second snippet states "Player7(Home Team) receives a yellow card for a rough tackle." This explicitly mentions Player7 receiving a yellow card. Therefore, Yellow Cards is incremented by 1.

All other events (Shots, Goals, Assists, Fouls, Red Cards, Offsides) are not explicitly mentioned in the snippets and unambiguously attributed to Player7, so their counts remain at 0. The "rough tackle" mentioned in the second snippet can be counted as a foul.
