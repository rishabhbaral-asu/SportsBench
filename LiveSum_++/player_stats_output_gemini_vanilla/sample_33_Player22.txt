Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the final summary table.

1.  **Identify the target player name:** The target player name is Player22.
2.  **Initialize counts:**
    *   Shots: 0
    *   Goals: 0
    *   Assists: 0
    *   Free Kicks: 0
    *   Fouls: 0
    *   Yellow Cards: 0
    *   Red Cards: 0
    *   Offsides: 0
3.  **Analyze each snippet:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player22(Away Team) misses the header from the center of the box, it goes high and wide to the right, Player29(Away Team) assisted with a cross after a set piece."
        *   "misses the header" indicates an attempt on goal. Therefore, Shots += 1
        *   Since Player29 assisted Player22, Player22 does not get an assist.

    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player22(Away Team) is causing a delay in the match due to an injury."
        *   This snippet does not contain any event information as defined.

    *   **Snippet 3:** "Player22(Away Team) attempts a through ball, but Player36(Away Team) is offside for the Away Team."
        *   Player22 attempts a through ball that does not lead to a goal (Player36 is offside), therefore no assist is awarded. Player22 does not commit the offside so no offside is awarded to Player22.

4.  **Final Counts:**
    *   Shots: 1
    *   Goals: 0
    *   Assists: 0
    *   Free Kicks: 0
    *   Fouls: 0
    *   Yellow Cards: 0
    *   Red Cards: 0
    *   Offsides: 0
