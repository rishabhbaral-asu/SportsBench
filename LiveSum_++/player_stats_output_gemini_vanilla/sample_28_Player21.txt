Okay, I'm ready to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the player statistics table.

**Player Name:** Player21

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player21(Away Team) attempts a through ball, but Player27(Away Team) is offside for the Away Team.
- Player21(Away Team)'s close-range shot with his right foot narrowly misses to the right, with an assist from Player25(Away Team).

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Player Identification:** The target player is Player21.

2.  **Initialization:** Initialize all counts to 0: Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

3.  **Snippet Analysis:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player21(Away Team) attempts a through ball, but Player27(Away Team) is offside for the Away Team."
        *   This snippet mentions Player21 attempting a through ball, but Player27 being offside. Player21 is not explicitly mentioned taking a shot, scoring, assisting, taking a free kick, committing a foul, or receiving any cards. Offsides is for Player27 not Player21.

    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player21(Away Team)'s close-range shot with his right foot narrowly misses to the right, with an assist from Player25(Away Team)."
        *   This snippet explicitly states that Player21 took a shot. So, Shots count increments to 1. Since the shot missed, the goal count is 0. The snippet mentions Player21 received an assist from Player25, meaning Player21 did not give an assist, so assists remain at 0.

4.  **Final Count:** After analyzing all snippets, the final counts are: Shots = 1, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown

| Player21 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
