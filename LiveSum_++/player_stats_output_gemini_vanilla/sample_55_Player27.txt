Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for Player27 and generate the summary table.

**Player Name:** Player27

**Commentary Snippets:**

*   Player27(Away Team) attempts a pass to Player29(Away Team), but Player29(Away Team) is offside.
*   Player27(Away Team) fouls Player4(Home Team), resulting in a free kick in the defensive half.
*   Player27(Away Team)'s shot from the center of the box is saved in the middle of the goal.
*   Player27(Away Team) narrowly misses a left-footed shot from the center of the box, assisted by Player28(Away Team), as Player7(Home Team) earns a free kick in the attacking half.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Shots:** The third snippet states "Player27(Away Team)'s shot from the center of the box is saved in the middle of the goal." and the fourth snippet states "Player27(Away Team) narrowly misses a left-footed shot from the center of the box...". Thus, the shot count is 2.
2.  **Goals:** No snippet explicitly mentions Player27 scoring a goal. Thus, the goal count is 0.
3.  **Assists:** The fourth snippet indicates Player27 was assisted by Player28 and thus Player27 provided no assists. Thus, the assist count is 0.
4.  **Free Kicks:** The first snippet mentions Player27 attempting a pass, not a free kick. The second snippet mentions Player27 committing a foul, resulting in a free kick for the opposing team; this does not count as a free kick *for* Player27. The fourth snippet states Player7 earns a free kick, which is irrelevant to Player27's free kick count. Thus, the free kick count is 0.
5.  **Fouls:** The second snippet explicitly states "Player27(Away Team) fouls Player4(Home Team)...". Thus, the foul count is 1.
6.  **Yellow Cards:** No snippet explicitly mentions Player27 receiving a yellow card. Thus, the yellow card count is 0.
7.  **Red Cards:** No snippet explicitly mentions Player27 receiving a red card. Thus, the red card count is 0.
8.  **Offsides:** The first snippet mentions Player29 being offside, not Player27. Thus, the offsides count is 0.
