Okay, I'm ready to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the player statistics table.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player8.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Analyze Snippets:**
    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player8(Home Team) from the Home Team attempts a pass to Player9(Home Team), but Player9(Home Team) is offside." - This snippet mentions Player8 attempting a pass but it leads to an offside, not a goal. Therefore, this is not an assist and it does not count as a shot or a goal. The snippet does not contain other relevant keywords. Offsides = 0
    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player8(Home Team) attempts a through ball, but Player3(Home Team) is offside for the Home Team." - This snippet mentions Player8 attempting a through ball, but it leads to an offside, not a goal. Therefore, this is not an assist and it does not count as a shot or a goal. The snippet does not contain other relevant keywords. Offsides = 0

4.  **Update Counts (Based on Snippet Analysis):**
    *   Shots = 0
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 0
    *   Fouls = 0
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0
5.  **Final Summary Table:**

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player8 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
