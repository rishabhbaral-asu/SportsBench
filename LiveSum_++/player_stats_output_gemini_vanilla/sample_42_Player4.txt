Okay, I'm ready to process the player commentary and generate the summary table.

**Step-by-step breakdown:**

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player4.
2.  **Initialize Counts:**
    *   Shots = 0
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 0
    *   Fouls = 0
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0
3.  **Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player4(Home Team) earns a free kick in their own half."
    *   This snippet explicitly states Player4 earned a free kick. Therefore, Free Kicks = 1.
*   Snippet 2: "Player4(Home Team) commits a foul."
    *   This snippet explicitly states Player4 committed a foul. Therefore, Fouls = 1.
*   Snippet 3: "Player4(Home Team)'s header from the center of the box is saved in the top right corner after an assist from Player8(Home Team) with a cross."
    *   This snippet explicitly states Player4's header was saved. This means Player4 took a shot. Therefore Shots = 1.

4.  **Final Counts:**
    *   Shots = 1
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 1
    *   Fouls = 1
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player4 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 1          | 1     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
