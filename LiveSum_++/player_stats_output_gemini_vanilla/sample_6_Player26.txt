Okay, let's process the input and generate the player statistics table.

**1. Identify the target player name:**

The target player is Player26.

**2. Initialize event counts:**

Shots = 0
Goals = 0
Assists = 0
Free Kicks = 0
Fouls = 0
Yellow Cards = 0
Red Cards = 0
Offsides = 0

**3. Analyze each commentary snippet:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player26(Away Team)'s right foot in the center of the box after a corner kick." - No explicit events to count here. It doesn't specify a shot, goal, foul, etc.

*   Snippet 2: "Player26(Away Team) commits a foul." -  Fouls = 1

*   Snippet 3: "Player26(Away Team) commits a foul." - Fouls = 2

*   Snippet 4: "Player26(Away Team) misses the target with a right-footed shot from outside the box." - Shots = 1

*   Snippet 5: "Player26(Away Team) attempts a through ball but Player28(Away Team) is offside for the Away Team." - No events to count. Player28 is offside, not Player26.

**4. Final Counts:**

Shots = 1
Goals = 0
Assists = 0
Free Kicks = 0
Fouls = 2
Yellow Cards = 0
Red Cards = 0
Offsides = 0

**5. Final Summary Table:**

```markdown

| Player26 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 2     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
