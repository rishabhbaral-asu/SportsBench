Okay, I'm ready to process the commentary snippets and generate the final summary table.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player11.

**2. Initialize Counters:**

*   Shots: 0
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player11(Home Team) from the left side of the box is blocked with Player3(Home Team)'s help."
    *   This snippet indicates an attempt on goal that was blocked. So, Shots += 1.
*   **Snippet 2:** "Player11(Home Team) misses the target with a high right-footed shot from outside the box on a direct free kick."
    *   This snippet indicates a shot was taken and missed. So, Shots += 1.
    *   The snippet explicitly states "...on a direct free kick", therefore Free Kicks += 1.
*   **Snippet 3:** "Player11(Home Team) passes the ball to Player9(Home Team), but Player9(Home Team) is offside."
    *   This snippet indicates Player9 was offside. Player11 passed the ball, but it did *not* lead to a goal, so no assist.
    *   Offsides += 0 (Since the target player is not offside, no increment occurs).
*   **Snippet 4:** "Player11(Home Team) earns a free kick in their own half."
    *   This snippet indicates Player11 was fouled or won the free kick. So, Free Kicks += 1.

**4. Final Counts:**

*   Shots: 2
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 2
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

**Final Summary Table:**
