Okay, let's process the provided input step-by-step to generate the final summary table.

1.  **Identify the target player:**
    The target player is Player2.

2.  **Initialize event counts:**
    Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0

3.  **Analyze each commentary snippet:**

    *   Snippet 1: "Player2(Home Team) commits a foul."
        *   Fouls += 1

    *   Snippet 2: "Player2(Home Team)'s difficult angled shot from the right is saved by the goalkeeper, assisted by Player9(Home Team), resulting in a corner kick for the Home Team."
        *   Shots += 1

4.  **Final Counts:**
    Shots = 1, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 1, Fouls = 3, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0
