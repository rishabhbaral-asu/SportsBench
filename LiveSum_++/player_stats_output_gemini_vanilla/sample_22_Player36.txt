Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the markdown table.

**Player Name:** Player36

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player36(Away Team)'s shot from the center of the box narrowly misses to the right.
- Player36(Away Team) is causing a delay in the game due to an injury.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Player Identification:** The target player is Player36.
2.  **Initialization:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Snippet Analysis:**
    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player36(Away Team)'s shot from the center of the box narrowly misses to the right."
        *   The snippet explicitly states that Player36 took a shot. Therefore, Shots = 1.
    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player36(Away Team) is causing a delay in the game due to an injury."
        *   This snippet does not explicitly describe any of the defined events (Shots, Goals, Assists, Free Kicks, Fouls, Yellow Cards, Red Cards, Offsides) performed by Player36. Therefore, no counts are incremented.

4. **Final Counts:** Shots = 1, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

**Final Summary Table:**
```markdown
