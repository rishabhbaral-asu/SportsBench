Okay, let's process the input and generate the player statistics table.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player4.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

*   Shots = 0
*   Goals = 0
*   Assists = 0
*   Free Kicks = 0
*   Fouls = 0
*   Yellow Cards = 0
*   Red Cards = 0
*   Offsides = 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player4(Home Team) commits a foul." - This explicitly states Player4 committed a foul. Therefore, Fouls += 1.

**4. Final Counts:**

*   Shots = 0
*   Goals = 0
*   Assists = 0
*   Free Kicks = 0
*   Fouls = 1
*   Yellow Cards = 0
*   Red Cards = 0
*   Offsides = 0

**5. Create Final Summary Table:**

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player4 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 1     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
