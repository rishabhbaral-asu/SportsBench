Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the final summary table.

**Player Name:**
Player27

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player27(Away Team) commits a foul.
- Player27(Away Team)'s left footed shot from the left side of the box is saved in the bottom right corner with an assist from Player21(Away Team).

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player27.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Analyze Snippets:**
    *   Snippet 1: "Player27(Away Team) commits a foul." This explicitly states Player27 committed a foul. Therefore, Fouls count is incremented by 1.
    *   Snippet 2: "Player27(Away Team)'s left footed shot from the left side of the box is saved in the bottom right corner with an assist from Player21(Away Team)." This explicitly states Player27 took a shot. Therefore, Shots count is incremented by 1. It also indicates that Player21 gave the assist, so Player27 gets no assist.

4.  **Final Counts:** Shots = 1, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 1, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

Final Summary Table:
