Okay, let's process the input and generate the player statistics table.

**Objective:** Analyze commentary snippets for Player6 and count explicit occurrences of defined events.

**Input:**
*   **Player Name:**
    ```
    <PLAYER_NAME>
    Player6
    </PLAYER_NAME>
    ```

    ```
    <PLAYER_COMMENTARY_SNIPPETS>
    - Player6(Home Team) commits a foul.
    - Player6(Home Team) earns a free kick in their own half.
    - Player6(Home Team) is currently sidelined due to an injury, causing a delay in the match.
    </PLAYER_COMMENTARY_SNIPPETS>
    ```
