Okay, I'm ready to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the player statistics table.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player21.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

*   Shots: 0
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player21(Away Team)'s left footed shot from the left side of the box narrowly misses to the left."
    *   This snippet explicitly mentions "shot" attributed to Player21.
    *   Increment Shots count: Shots = 1

**4. Final Counts:**

*   Shots: 1
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

**5. Final Summary Table:**
