Okay, let's analyze the commentary snippets for Player6 and compile the statistics.

**Player Name:** Player6

**Commentary Snippets:**

*   Player6(Home Team)'s header from the center of the box is saved by the goalkeeper after a cross from Player7(Home Team).
*   Player6(Home Team) attempts a through pass, but Player11(Home Team) is offside.

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

1.  **Shots:** The first snippet mentions "Player6(Home Team)'s header from the center of the box is saved by the goalkeeper". This indicates a shot attempt (a header that was saved), so we increment the shot count.

2.  **Goals:** Neither snippet explicitly states that Player6 scored a goal. So, the goal count remains 0.

3.  **Assists:** The snippets do not explicitly state that Player6 provided an assist that directly led to a goal. The second snippet says "Player6(Home Team) attempts a through pass, but Player11(Home Team) is offside", meaning the attempted pass didn't lead to a goal. Therefore, the assist count remains 0.

4.  **Free Kicks:** Neither snippet mentions Player6 taking a free kick or penalty kick. The second snippet indicates a through pass which was deemed offside, so not a free kick. Therefore, the free kick count remains 0.

5.  **Fouls:** Neither snippet mentions Player6 committing a foul. Therefore, the foul count remains 0.

6.  **Yellow Cards:** Neither snippet mentions Player6 receiving a yellow card. Therefore, the yellow card count remains 0.

7.  **Red Cards:** Neither snippet mentions Player6 receiving a red card. Therefore, the red card count remains 0.

8.  **Offsides:** The second snippet mentions "Player6(Home Team) attempts a through pass, but Player11(Home Team) is offside." This is an offside *against* Player11, not Player6. Player6 made the pass, but that doesn't mean Player6 was offside. Therefore, the offsides count remains 0.

**Final Summary Table:**
