Okay, let's process the commentary snippets for Player2 and generate the summary table.

1.  **Player Name:**
    `<PLAYER_NAME>`
    `Player2`
    `</PLAYER_NAME>`
    The target player is Player2.

2.  **Initialize Counts:**
    *   Shots = 0
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 0
    *   Fouls = 0
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0

3.  **Analyze Commentary Snippets:**
    *   Snippet 1: "Player2(Home Team) misses the target with a high right-footed shot from the right side of the box."
        *   This snippet explicitly states Player2 missed a shot. Therefore, increment Shots by 1.

    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
