1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player2.

2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

3.  **Analyze Snippets:**

    *   Snippet 1: "Player2(Home Team) from taking a shot with their right foot from the center of the box."
        *   This snippet explicitly mentions Player2 taking a shot. Therefore, increment Shots by 1. Since it's a shot, we now have Shots = 1.
