Okay, I'm ready to analyze the commentary snippets for the given player and generate the final summary table.

**1. Identify the target player:**

The target player is Player26.

**2. Initialize event counts:**

Shots = 0
Goals = 0
Assists = 0
Free Kicks = 0
Fouls = 0
Yellow Cards = 0
Red Cards = 0
Offsides = 0

**3. Analyze commentary snippets:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player26(Away Team) earns a free kick in their own half."

    *   This snippet explicitly states Player26 earns a free kick. This means Player26 was fouled and thus wins a free kick.

    *   Increment Free Kicks: Free Kicks = 0 + 1 = 1

**4. Final Summary Table:**

```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player26 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 1          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
