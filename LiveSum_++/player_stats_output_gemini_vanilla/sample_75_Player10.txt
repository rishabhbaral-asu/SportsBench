Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1.  **Identify Player:** The target player is Player10.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Analyze Snippets:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player10(Home Team) earns a free kick on the right side of the field." - Player10 earns a free kick. Increment Free Kicks by 1.
    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player10(Home Team)'s long-range shot with their left foot." - Player10 takes a shot. Increment Shots by 1.
    *   **Snippet 3:** "Player10(Home Team)'s left footed shot from outside the box is saved in the top centre of the goal, assisted by Player4(Home Team), resulting in a corner kick for the Home Team." - Player10 takes a shot. Increment Shots by 1. The shot was saved. Player10 was assisted by Player4. This is not an assist *by* Player10, therefore do not increment assists.

4.  **Final Counts:** Shots = 2, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 1, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
