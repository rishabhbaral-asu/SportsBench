Okay, I'm ready to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the player statistics table.

**Player Name:** Player9

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player9(Home Team)'s shot from the center of the box is blocked with his right foot, after being assisted by Player4(Home Team).
- Player9(Home Team) earns a free kick on the right wing after being fouled by Player24(Away Team).
- Player9(Home Team) commits a foul, resulting in Player36(Away Team) earning a free kick on the right wing, .
- Player9(Home Team) earns a free kick on the left wing after being fouled by Player20(Away Team).
- Player9(Home Team) commits a foul.
- Player9(Home Team) commits a foul and Player24(Away Team) earns a free kick on the left side of the field.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Shots:** The first snippet explicitly mentions "Player9(Home Team)'s shot...is blocked". Therefore, Shots = 1.
2.  **Goals:** No snippet explicitly states Player9 scored a goal. Therefore, Goals = 0.
3.  **Assists:** No snippet explicitly states Player9 provided an assist leading to a goal. The first snippet mentions Player9 was *assisted by* another player, so that does not count as an assist for Player9. Therefore, Assists = 0.
4.  **Free Kicks (Taken):** The second snippet mentions "Player9(Home Team) earns a free kick...after being fouled". This implies Player9 will take the resulting free kick, so Free Kicks = 1. The fourth snippet mentions "Player9(Home Team) earns a free kick...after being fouled". This implies Player9 will take the resulting free kick, so Free Kicks = 2.
5.  **Fouls (Committed):** The third snippet states "Player9(Home Team) commits a foul...". Therefore, Fouls = 1. The fifth snippet states "Player9(Home Team) commits a foul." Therefore, Fouls = 2. The sixth snippet states "Player9(Home Team) commits a foul". Therefore Fouls=3
6.  **Yellow Cards:** No snippet explicitly mentions Player9 receiving a yellow card. Therefore, Yellow Cards = 0.
7.  **Red Cards:** No snippet explicitly mentions Player9 receiving a red card. Therefore, Red Cards = 0.
8.  **Offsides:** No snippet explicitly mentions Player9 being offsides. Therefore, Offsides = 0.

**Final Summary Table:**
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player9 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 2          | 3     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
