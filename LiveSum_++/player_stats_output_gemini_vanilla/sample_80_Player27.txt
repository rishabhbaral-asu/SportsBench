Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the given player and generate the final summary table.

**Commentary Snippets:**

**Analysis:**

1.  **Shots:** The first snippet states "Player27(Away Team)'s shot...narrowly misses". This is a shot attempt, so increment the shot count by 1.
2.  **Goals:** No goal is mentioned in any of the snippets.
3.  **Assists:** The first snippet mentions "with an assist from Player25(Away Team)". This means Player27 received an assist, not provided one. Therefore, assist count remains 0.
4.  **Free Kicks (Taken):** The second snippet states "Player27(Away Team) earns a free kick...". The fourth snippet says "Player27(Away Team) earns a free kick...". Since Player27 *earns* the free kick, this counts as a free kick (taken). So, free kicks count is incremented by 2.
