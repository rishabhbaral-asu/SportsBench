Okay, let's break down the process step-by-step.

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player8.

2.  **Initialize Counts:**
    *   Shots = 0
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 0
    *   Fouls = 0
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0

3.  **Analyze Snippets:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player8(Home Team) earns a free kick in their own defensive territory."
        *   This snippet explicitly states Player8 earned a free kick. Therefore, increment Free Kicks by 1. Free Kicks = 1

    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player8(Home Team)'s attempt from outside the box with his right foot is blocked, with an assist from Player10(Home Team)."
        *   This snippet explicitly states Player8 made an attempt (shot) that was blocked. So increment Shots by 1. Shots = 1. Since this was not a goal, Goals remains at 0.

4.  **Final Counts:**
    *   Shots = 1
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 1
    *   Fouls = 0
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:

| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player8 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 1          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
