3.  **Snippet Analysis:**
    *   Snippet 1: "Player17(Home Team) attempts a through ball to Player9(Home Team), who is offside."
        *   The snippet states that Player17 attempts a through ball to Player9 who is offside. This means Player17 is the one passing the ball, and Player9 is offside, but because the ball did not directly result in a goal and there is no clear statement of an assist, and the passage does not explicitly state that this counts as a shot, goal, free kick, foul, or card. Only Offsides needs to be considered.
        *   Offsides: Player17 is passing to the player that is offside. Player17 is not the one that is offside, therefore Offsides does not increment.
