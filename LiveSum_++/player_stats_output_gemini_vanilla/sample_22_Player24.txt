Okay, I'm ready to process the input and generate the player statistics table.

**Player Name:**
Player24

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player24(Away Team)'s header from the center of the box is blocked.

Reasoning:

1.  The target player is Player24.
2.  Initialize all event counts to 0.
3.  Analyze the commentary snippets:
    *   Snippet 1: "Player24(Away Team)'s header from the center of the box is blocked." This explicitly mentions Player24 taking a header that was blocked. Therefore, increment the 'Shots' count by 1.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player24 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
