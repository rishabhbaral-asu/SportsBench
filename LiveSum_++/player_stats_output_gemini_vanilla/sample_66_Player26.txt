    *   This snippet explicitly states Player26 committed a foul. Increment Fouls by 1.

*   Snippet 3: "Player26(Away Team)'s shot from the right side of the box is saved in the center of the goal, with an assist from Player27(Away Team)."
    *   This snippet explicitly states Player26 took a shot. Increment Shots by 1. The shot was saved, but it is still a shot.
