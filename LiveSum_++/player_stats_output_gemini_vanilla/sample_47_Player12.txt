Okay, let's analyze the commentary snippets for Player12 and generate the summary table.

**1. Identify Target Player:**
The target player is Player12.

**2. Initialize Counts:**
Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player12(Home Team)'s header from the left side of the box misses to the left, assisted by Player4(Home Team)."
    *   "header" - Since Player12's header is an attempt on goal (even if it missed), increment Shots by 1.
    *   The snippet indicates Player12 was *assisted by* Player4. Therefore, no assist is attributed to Player12.

**4. Final Counts:**
Shots = 1, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0

**5. Create Summary Table:**
