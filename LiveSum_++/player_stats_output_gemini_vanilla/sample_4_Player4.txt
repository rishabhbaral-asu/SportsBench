Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the markdown table.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player4.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

*   Shots: 0
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player4(Home Team) commits a foul."
    *   This snippet explicitly states Player4 committed a foul.
    *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 1

*   Snippet 2: "Player4(Home Team) assisted by Player7(Home Team)."
    *   This snippet explicitly states Player4 was assisted *by* someone else.
    *   Do NOT increment Assists (as Player4 was not the one providing the assist).

**4. Final Counts:**

*   Shots: 0
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 1
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

**5. Final Summary Table:**

```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player4 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 1     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
