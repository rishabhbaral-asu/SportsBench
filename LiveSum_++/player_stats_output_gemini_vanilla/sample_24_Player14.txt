Okay, I understand the instructions. I will analyze the commentary snippets for Player14 and count the occurrences of each specified event, following the strict counting rules and formatting requirements.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Player Name:** The target player is Player14.
2.  **Initialization:** Initialize all event counts to 0 for Player14.
3.  **Snippet Analysis:**
    *   Snippet 1: "Player14(Home Team) was delayed due to an injury, but now the delay is over and they are ready to continue." This snippet does not contain any of the specified event keywords. Therefore, no counts are incremented.

4.  **Final Counts:** Based on the analysis, all event counts for Player14 remain at 0.
