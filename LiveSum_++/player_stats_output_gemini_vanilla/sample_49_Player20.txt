Okay, let's start by identifying the player name and initializing the counts.

Player Name: Player20

Now, let's analyze the commentary snippets and increment the counts based on the instructions.

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player20(Away Team) commits a foul."
    *   Fouls: Increment by 1. Total Fouls = 1

*   **Snippet 2:** "Player20(Away Team) misses the target with a right-footed shot from the right side of the box."
    *   Shots: Increment by 1. Total Shots = 1

*   **Snippet 3:** "Player20(Away Team) commits a foul on Player11(Home Team) in their own defensive half, resulting in a free kick being awarded."
    *   Fouls: Increment by 1. Total Fouls = 2

*   **Snippet 4:** "Player20(Away Team) commits a foul."
    *   Fouls: Increment by 1. Total Fouls = 3

Now, let's create the final summary table.
