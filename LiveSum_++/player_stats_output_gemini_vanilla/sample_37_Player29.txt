Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the final summary table for the given player.

**Player Name:** Player29

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player29(Away Team) is caught offside after Player5(Home Team) attempts a through ball.
- Player29(Away Team)'s right footed shot from outside the box, assisted by Player27(Away Team), is blocked and misses to the left.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Shots:** The second snippet explicitly mentions "Player29(Away Team)'s right footed shot...is blocked and misses to the left." This clearly indicates Player29 took a shot. Therefore, the shot count is incremented by 1.
2.  **Goals:** Neither snippet mentions Player29 scoring a goal. The goal count remains 0.
3.  **Assists:** The second snippet states "assisted by Player27(Away Team)". Since Player29 was *assisted by* another player, Player29 did not provide an assist. The assist count remains 0.
4.  **Free Kicks:** Neither snippet explicitly states Player29 took a free kick or penalty kick. The free kick count remains 0.
5.  **Fouls:** Neither snippet explicitly states Player29 committed a foul. The foul count remains 0.
6.  **Yellow Cards:** Neither snippet explicitly states Player29 received a yellow card. The yellow card count remains 0.
7.  **Red Cards:** Neither snippet explicitly states Player29 received a red card. The red card count remains 0.
8.  **Offsides:** The first snippet explicitly mentions "Player29(Away Team) is caught offside". Therefore, the offsides count is incremented by 1.
