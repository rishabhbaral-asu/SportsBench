Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for Player4 and generate the final summary table.

**Commentary Snippets:**

*   "Player4(Home Team) commits a foul, resulting in Player22(Away Team) being awarded a free kick in their own defensive half."

2.  **Goals:** There are no snippets explicitly mentioning Player4 scoring a goal.
3.  **Assists:** The second snippet mentions Player4 being assisted, but does not indicate player4 providing an assist. So the assist count remains 0.
4.  **Free Kicks:** The first and third snippets mention player 4 committing fouls that led to free kicks. But player4 didn't take the free kick. So, free kick count remains at 0.
5.  **Fouls:** The first snippet states "Player4(Home Team) commits a foul". The third snippet states "Player4(Home Team) commits a foul". Thus, Player4 committed two fouls, so the foul count is incremented by 2.
