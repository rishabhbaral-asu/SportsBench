Okay, let's break down the process step-by-step, applying the instructions rigorously.

1.  **Identify Target Player:**
    The target player is Player22.

2.  **Initialize Counts:**
    Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0

3.  **Analyze Snippets:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player22(Away Team) misses with a right-footed shot from outside the box, going wide to the left."
        *   This snippet explicitly mentions "shot" by Player22.
        *   Increment Shots: Shots = 0 + 1 = 1

    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player22(Away Team) commits a foul."
        *   This snippet explicitly mentions "foul" committed by Player22.
        *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 0 + 1 = 1

    *   **Snippet 3:** "Player22(Away Team) receives a yellow card for a reckless challenge."
        *   This snippet explicitly mentions "yellow card" received by Player22.
        *   The snippet also implies a foul through "reckless challenge".
        *   Increment Yellow Cards: Yellow Cards = 0 + 1 = 1
        *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 1 + 1 = 2

4.  **Final Counts:**
    Shots = 1, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 2, Yellow Cards = 1, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:

| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |

| Player22 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 2     | 1            | 0         | 0        |
