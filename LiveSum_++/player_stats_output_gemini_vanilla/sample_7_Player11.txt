Okay, let's break down the task step-by-step and apply the rules rigorously.

1.  **Identify Target Player:**
    The target player is Player11.

2.  **Initialize Counts:**
    Shots = 0
    Goals = 0
    Assists = 0
    Free Kicks = 0
    Fouls = 0
    Yellow Cards = 0
    Red Cards = 0
    Offsides = 0

3.  **Analyze Snippets:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player11(Home Team) of the Home Team attempts a through ball, but Player9(Home Team) is flagged for being offside."
        *   Player11 attempts a through ball, but it leads to an offside. This does not explicitly mean it led to a goal. Thus no assist.
        *   Player9 is offside. This is offside for Player9 not Player11.
        *   No Shots, Goals, Fouls, Yellow Cards, Red Cards, or Free Kicks mentioned. Offsides is not applicable for Player11.
    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player11(Home Team) misses the target with a left-footed shot from the left side of the box, assisted by Player3(Home Team)."
        *   Player11 misses the target with a shot. So Shots = 1.
        *   Player3 assisted. This is *not* an assist for Player11.
        *   No Goals, Fouls, Yellow Cards, Red Cards, Free Kicks, or Offsides mentioned.

4.  **Final Counts:**
    Shots = 1
    Goals = 0
    Assists = 0
    Free Kicks = 0
    Fouls = 0
    Yellow Cards = 0
    Red Cards = 0
    Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player11 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
