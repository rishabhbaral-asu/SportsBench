Okay, let's start by identifying the player name and initializing the counts for all events.

Now, let's analyze the commentary snippets and increment the counts accordingly, following the strict counting rules.

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player22(Away Team) is currently sidelined due to an injury, causing a delay in the match."
    *   No events to count.
