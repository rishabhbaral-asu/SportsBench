Okay, let's start by extracting the player name and commentary snippets.

Player Name: Player23
Commentary Snippets:
- Player23(Away Team) misses a left-footed shot from the center of the box after the Away Team obtains a corner kick.

Now, let's initialize the counts for each event:

Shots: 0
Goals: 0
Assists: 0
Free Kicks: 0
Fouls: 0
Yellow Cards: 0
Red Cards: 0
Offsides: 0

Now we analyze the commentary snippets and increment counts where appropriate based on the defined keywords and the Absolute Strict Counting & Unambiguous Attribution rule.

Snippet 1: "Player23(Away Team) misses a left-footed shot from the center of the box after the Away Team obtains a corner kick."
This snippet mentions "shot" and the action is explicitly attributed to Player23. Therefore, we increment the "Shots" count.

Final Counts:

Shots: 1
Goals: 0
Assists: 0
Free Kicks: 0
Fouls: 0
Yellow Cards: 0
Red Cards: 0
Offsides: 0

Now, let's format the final summary table.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
