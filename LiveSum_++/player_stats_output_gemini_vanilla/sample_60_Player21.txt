Okay, let's start by identifying the player and initializing the counts.

Player Name: Player21

Initial Counts:
Shots: 0
Goals: 0
Assists: 0
Free Kicks: 0
Fouls: 0
Yellow Cards: 0
Red Cards: 0
Offsides: 0

Now, let's analyze the commentary snippets:

Snippet 1: "Player21(Away Team) attempts a through ball, but Player29(Away Team) is offside for the Away Team."
This snippet mentions Player21 attempting a through ball, but it doesn't explicitly say it led to a goal. There's no shot or goal here either. This is not an assist for Player21 since Player29 was offside. It's not a free kick or foul either. The snippet *does* say Player21 attempts a through ball so it could be an assist if it leads to a goal, but it does not. No cards mentioned. It also doesn't indicate Player21 was offside so there is no increment to offsides.

Snippet 2: "Player21(Away Team) commits a foul."
This snippet explicitly states that Player21 commits a foul. So, we increment the foul count by 1. No other event is mentioned in this snippet.

Final Counts:
Shots: 0
Goals: 0
Assists: 0
Free Kicks: 0
Fouls: 1
Yellow Cards: 0
Red Cards: 0
Offsides: 0
