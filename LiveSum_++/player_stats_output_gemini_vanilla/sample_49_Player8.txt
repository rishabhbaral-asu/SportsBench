Okay, I'm ready to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the player statistics table.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player8.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

*   Shots = 0
*   Goals = 0
*   Assists = 0
*   Free Kicks = 0
*   Fouls = 0
*   Yellow Cards = 0
*   Red Cards = 0
*   Offsides = 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player8(Home Team) earns a free kick deep in their own territory."
    *   This snippet indicates Player8 earned a free kick. Therefore, Free Kicks = 0 + 1 = 1.

*   Snippet 2: "Player8(Home Team) commits a foul."
    *   This snippet indicates Player8 committed a foul. Therefore, Fouls = 0 + 1 = 1.

**4. Final Counts:**

*   Shots = 0
*   Goals = 0
*   Assists = 0
*   Free Kicks = 1
*   Fouls = 1
*   Yellow Cards = 0
*   Red Cards = 0
*   Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:
