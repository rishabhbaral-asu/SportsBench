Okay, let's start.

1.  **Identify Player Name:**
    The player name from `<PLAYER_NAME>` is Player4.

2.  **Initialize Counts:**
    Shots = 0
    Goals = 0
    Assists = 0
    Free Kicks = 0
    Fouls = 0
    Yellow Cards = 0
    Red Cards = 0
    Offsides = 0

3.  **Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

    *   Snippet 1: "Player4(Home Team)'s shot from outside the box is blocked."
        *   The snippet explicitly states that Player4 took a shot, so increment Shots.

4.  **Final Counts:**
    Shots = 1
    Goals = 0
    Assists = 0
    Free Kicks = 0
    Fouls = 0
    Yellow Cards = 0
    Red Cards = 0
    Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:
