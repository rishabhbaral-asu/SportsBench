3.  **Analyze Snippets:**

    *   Snippet 1: "Player3(Home Team) misses the target with a high and wide shot from outside the box, assisted by Player4(Home Team)."
        *   The snippet explicitly states "Player3 misses the target with a...shot". This clearly indicates a shot attempt by Player3. Therefore, increment the 'Shots' count by 1.
        *   The snippet mentions Player3 was *assisted by* Player4. This means Player3 received the assist, and did not *give* one. Therefore, do NOT increment assists.
