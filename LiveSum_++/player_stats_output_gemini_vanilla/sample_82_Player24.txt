Okay, I understand the instructions. I will analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player, count the occurrences of the defined events based on the provided keywords and strict attribution rules, and then present the results in a markdown table.

**Player Name:** Player24

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player24(Away Team) from Away Team has been awarded a free kick in their own half.

Reasoning:

1.  **Player Identification:** The target player is Player24.
2.  **Initialization:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Snippet Analysis:**

    *   Snippet 1: "Player24(Away Team) from Away Team has been awarded a free kick in their own half." This indicates Player24 has been awarded a free kick, which means he wins a free kick. So Free Kicks += 1.

4.  **Final Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 1, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
