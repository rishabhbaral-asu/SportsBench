Okay, let's start.

First, I will identify the target player name.
The target player name is Player26.

Second, I will initialize the counts for all the events to 0.
Shots = 0
Goals = 0
Assists = 0
Free Kicks = 0
Fouls = 0
Yellow Cards = 0
Red Cards = 0
Offsides = 0

Third, I will analyze each snippet and increment the counts based on the instructions.

Snippet 1: Player26(Away Team) commits a foul.
This snippet explicitly states that Player26 commits a foul.
Therefore, Fouls += 1.

Fourth, I will compile the final summary table.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player26 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 1     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
