Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player21.
2. **Initialize Counts:**
    * Shots = 0
    * Goals = 0
    * Assists = 0
    * Free Kicks = 0
    * Fouls = 0
    * Yellow Cards = 0
    * Red Cards = 0
    * Offsides = 0

3. **Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player21(Away Team) with the foul."
    *   This explicitly states Player21 committed a foul.
    *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 1

*   **Snippet 2:** "Player21(Away Team) commits a foul, resulting in Player9(Home Team) winning a free kick in the attacking half, The foul was committed by Player21(Away Team), leading to Player9(Home Team) being awarded a free kick in the attacking half."
    *   This explicitly states Player21 committed a foul.
    *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 2

4.  **Compile Final Counts:**
    *   Shots = 0
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 0
    *   Fouls = 2
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0
