Okay, I'm ready to analyze the commentary snippets and create the final summary table.

**Player Name:** Player30

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player30(Away Team) misses a right-footed shot from the center of the box, assisted by Player25(Away Team), following a set piece, while Player28(Away Team)'s shot from outside the box is blocked.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Shots:** The snippet states "Player30(Away Team) misses a right-footed shot from the center of the box". This is an explicit shot attempt. Therefore, Shots = 1.
2.  **Goals:** The snippet does not say Player30 scored a goal. Therefore, Goals = 0.
3.  **Assists:** The snippet mentions "assisted by Player25(Away Team)". This means Player30 received the assist, but did not provide it. Therefore, Assists = 0.
4.  **Free Kicks:** The snippet states "...following a set piece...". This does not explicitly indicate that the target player took the free kick or won the free kick/penalty. Therefore, Free Kicks = 0.
5.  **Fouls:** The snippet does not mention Player30 committing a foul. Therefore, Fouls = 0.
6.  **Yellow Cards:** The snippet does not mention Player30 receiving a yellow card. Therefore, Yellow Cards = 0.
7.  **Red Cards:** The snippet does not mention Player30 receiving a red card. Therefore, Red Cards = 0.
8.  **Offsides:** The snippet does not mention Player30 being offsides. Therefore, Offsides = 0.

Final Summary Table:
