Okay, let's break down the task. I need to analyze the commentary snippets for Player14 and count the occurrences of specific soccer events. I will follow the provided definitions and instructions strictly and build the requested markdown table.

Here's how I will process this:

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player14.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** I'll start with zero counts for Shots, Goals, Assists, Free Kicks, Fouls, Yellow Cards, Red Cards, and Offsides.
3.  **Analyze Snippets:** I'll go through each snippet and increment the relevant counts *only* when the action is explicitly and unambiguously attributed to Player14.

Here's the analysis of each snippet:

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player14(Home Team) wins a free kick in their own defensive half." - This clearly states that Player14 wins a free kick. Thus, Free Kicks is incremented.
*   **Snippet 2:** "Player14(Home Team)'s shot from outside the box with his right foot in the center of the goal." - This explicitly states Player14 took a shot and scored a goal. Shots and Goals are incremented.
*   **Snippet 3:** "Player14(Home Team)'s attempt from outside the box with their right foot went wide to the left, after being assisted by Player3(Home Team) during a fast break." - Player14 took a shot, and it was an attempt. Shots incremented. No assist for Player14 here because Player3 assisted Player14, not the other way around.

Now, let's compile the counts:

*   Shots: 1 (from snippet 2) + 1 (from snippet 3) = 2
*   Goals: 1 (from snippet 2)
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 1 (from snippet 1)
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player14 | 2     | 1     | 0       | 1          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
