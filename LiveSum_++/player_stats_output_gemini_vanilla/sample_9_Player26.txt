Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the final summary table.

**Player Name:** Player26

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player26(Away Team) misses the goal with a right footed shot from outside the box, assisted by Player36(Away Team).
- Player26(Away Team) of the Away Team attempts a through ball, but Player34(Away Team) is offside.

**Analysis:**

*   **Shots:** The first snippet states "Player26(Away Team) misses the goal with a right footed shot". This clearly indicates a shot attempt by Player26, so the shot count is incremented by 1.
*   **Goals:** The snippets do not explicitly mention Player26 scoring a goal.
*   **Assists:** The first snippet indicates that Player26 was *assisted by* Player36. This means Player26 did not provide an assist, so the assist count remains at 0.
