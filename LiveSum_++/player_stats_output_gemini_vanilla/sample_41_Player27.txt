Okay, I understand the instructions. I will analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player, count the occurrences of each defined event based on the presence of specific keywords, and then present the results in a markdown table. I will adhere to the strict counting rules, focusing only on explicitly stated and unambiguously attributed events.

**Player Name:** Player27

**Commentary Snippets:**

*   Player27(Away Team) earns a free kick in the opponent's half.
*   Player27(Away Team)'s shot from close range on the right side is saved in the bottom right corner.
*   Player27(Away Team) committed a foul.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Player Identification:** The target player is Player27.
2.  **Initialization:** Initialize all event counts to 0 for Player27.
3.  **Snippet Analysis:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player27(Away Team) earns a free kick in the opponent's half."
        *   The phrase "earns a free kick" explicitly indicates Player27 won a free kick. So, Free Kicks (taken) count increments by 1.
    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player27(Away Team)'s shot from close range on the right side is saved in the bottom right corner."
        *   The word "shot" explicitly indicates Player27 took a shot. So, Shots count increments by 1.
    *   **Snippet 3:** "Player27(Away Team) committed a foul."
        *   The phrase "committed a foul" explicitly indicates Player27 committed a foul. So, Fouls count increments by 1.

4.  **Final Counts:**
    *   Shots: 1
    *   Goals: 0
    *   Assists: 0
    *   Free Kicks: 1
    *   Fouls: 1
    *   Yellow Cards: 0
    *   Red Cards: 0
    *   Offsides: 0
