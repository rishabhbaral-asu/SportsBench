Okay, I'm ready to process the commentary snippets and generate the player statistics table.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player4.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

Shots: 0, Goals: 0, Assists: 0, Free Kicks: 0, Fouls: 0, Yellow Cards: 0, Red Cards: 0, Offsides: 0

**3. Analyze Snippets:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player4(Home Team) fouls Player28(Away Team), who wins a free kick on the left wing."
    *   Fouls: Player4 commits a foul. Increment Fouls to 1.
    *   Free Kicks: Player4 fouls Player28, so Player28 wins a free kick. This doesn't count as a free kick for Player4, since he didn't take the kick.
*   **Snippet 2:** "Player4(Home Team)'s attempt with his right foot from outside the box is blocked."
    *   Shots: Player4 attempts a shot which is blocked. Increment Shots to 1.
*   **Snippet 3:** "Player4(Home Team) earns a free kick in their own half after being fouled by Player27(Away Team)."
    *   Free Kicks: Player4 earns a free kick. Increment Free Kicks to 1.
*   **Snippet 4:** "Player4(Home Team) committed a foul."
    *   Fouls: Player4 committed a foul. Increment Fouls to 2.

**4. Final Counts:**

Shots: 1, Goals: 0, Assists: 0, Free Kicks: 1, Fouls: 2, Yellow Cards: 0, Red Cards: 0, Offsides: 0
