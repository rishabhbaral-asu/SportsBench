Also, I made an error with the amount of fouls. The correct amount is 2, not 3.
Also, I forgot to include yellow cards and red cards in the table as well.

I need to add one more example including the yellow card statistic to showcase the example and incorporate it into the prompt.

Updated Snippet:
* Player10(Home Team) is shown a yellow card.

New code:
