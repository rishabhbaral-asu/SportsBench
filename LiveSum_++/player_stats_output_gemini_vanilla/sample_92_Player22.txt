Okay, I understand the instructions. I will analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player, count the occurrences of the defined events based on the keywords, and present the results in a markdown table.

**Player Name:**
Player22

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player22(Away Team) earns a free kick in their own half.

Reasoning:
1. **Player Name:** The target player is Player22.
2. **Initialization:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3. **Snippet Analysis:**
   - "Player22(Away Team) earns a free kick in their own half." This snippet explicitly states that Player22 earned a free kick. "earns a free kick" is a keyword for "Free Kicks (Taken)".
4. **Increment Counts:**
   - Free Kicks: 1 (because Player22 earned a free kick)
5. **Final Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 1, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
