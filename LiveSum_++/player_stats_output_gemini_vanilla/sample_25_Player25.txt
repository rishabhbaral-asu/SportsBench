Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the final summary table.

**Player Name:** Player25

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player25(Away Team)'s left footed shot from outside the box is blocked after being assisted by Player27(Away Team), with Player11(Home Team) caught offside from Player8(Home Team)'s through ball for the Home Team.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Shots:** The snippet mentions "Player25(Away Team)'s left footed shot from outside the box is blocked". This clearly indicates an attempt on goal by Player25, so the Shot count is incremented by 1.
2.  **Goals:** The snippet does not explicitly state Player25 scored a goal.
3.  **Assists:** The snippet mentions Player25 was "assisted by Player27(Away Team)". Because Player25 was assisted *by* another player, and did not provide an assist, this does not increment the assist counter.
4.  **Free Kicks:** The snippet does not mention Player25 taking a free kick, penalty, being fouled, or winning a free kick.
5.  **Fouls:** The snippet does not mention Player25 committing any fouls.
6.  **Yellow Cards:** The snippet does not mention Player25 receiving a yellow card.
7.  **Red Cards:** The snippet does not mention Player25 receiving a red card.
8.  **Offsides:** The snippet does not mention Player25 being offside.
