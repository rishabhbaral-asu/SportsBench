Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the final summary table.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player22.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Analyze Snippets:**
    *   Snippet 1: "Player22(Away Team) earns a free kick in the opponent's half." - This indicates Player22 earned a free kick. Therefore, Free Kicks = 1.
    *   Snippet 2: "Player22(Away Team) receives a yellow card for a rough challenge." - This indicates Player22 received a yellow card. Therefore, Yellow Cards = 1. Since Player22 received a yellow card *for* a rough challenge, it also implies a foul was committed. Therefore, Fouls = 1.
4.  **Final Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 1, Fouls = 1, Yellow Cards = 1, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
