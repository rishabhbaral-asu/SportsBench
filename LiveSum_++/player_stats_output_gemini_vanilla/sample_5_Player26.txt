Okay, let's break down the process step by step.

1.  **Identify Target Player:**
    The target player is Player26.

2.  **Initialize Counts:**
    Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

3.  **Analyze Snippets:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player26(Away Team) commits a foul on Player11(Home Team), who wins a free kick in the attacking half, This results in a set piece opportunity for the attacking team."
        *   Fouls: The snippet explicitly states "Player26 commits a foul". Increment Fouls by 1.
        * Free Kicks: The snippet says Player11 "wins a free kick". This does not count towards Player26 free kicks.
    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player26(Away Team) fouls Player4(Home Team), resulting in a free kick in the defensive half."
        *   Fouls: The snippet explicitly states "Player26 fouls Player4". Increment Fouls by 1.

4.  **Compile Final Counts:**
    Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 2, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

Final Summary Table:

| Player26 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 2     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
