**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player3.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player3(Home Team) is awarded a free kick in their own half."

    *   This snippet explicitly states that Player3 was awarded a free kick. This counts as a Free Kick (taken).
