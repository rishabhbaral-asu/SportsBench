Okay, let's break down the task. I need to analyze the commentary snippets provided and count the occurrences of specific events for the given player ("Player22"). I must adhere to the strict counting rules and definitions provided, ensuring that events are only counted if they are explicitly and unambiguously attributed to the target player.

**Player Name:** Player22

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player22(Away Team) commits the foul, giving Player10(Home Team) a free kick on the right wing.
- Player22(Away Team) receives a yellow card for a rough tackle.

**Step-by-step analysis:**

1. **Initialize Counts:**
   - Shots = 0
   - Goals = 0
   - Assists = 0
   - Free Kicks = 0
   - Fouls = 0
   - Yellow Cards = 0
   - Red Cards = 0
   - Offsides = 0

2. **Analyze Snippets:**

   - **Snippet 1:** "Player22(Away Team) commits the foul, giving Player10(Home Team) a free kick on the right wing."
     - The snippet explicitly states "Player22 commits the foul". So, Fouls += 1. Player22 is conceding the free kick which counts as a foul.
   - **Snippet 2:** "Player22(Away Team) receives a yellow card for a rough tackle."
     - The snippet explicitly states "Player22 receives a yellow card". So, Yellow Cards += 1.

3. **Final Counts:**
   - Shots = 0
   - Goals = 0
   - Assists = 0
   - Free Kicks = 0
   - Fouls = 1
   - Yellow Cards = 1
   - Red Cards = 0
   - Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player22 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 1     | 1            | 0         | 0        |
