Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the final summary table.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player2.

**2. Initialize Event Counts:**

Shots = 0
Goals = 0
Assists = 0
Free Kicks = 0
Fouls = 0
Yellow Cards = 0
Red Cards = 0
Offsides = 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player2(Home Team) earns a free kick in their own half."
    *   This snippet explicitly states that Player2 earned a free kick.
    *   Therefore, increment Free Kicks by 1.

**4. Final Counts:**

Shots = 0
Goals = 0
Assists = 0
Free Kicks = 1
Fouls = 0
Yellow Cards = 0
Red Cards = 0
Offsides = 0

**5. Final Summary Table:**

Final Summary Table:
