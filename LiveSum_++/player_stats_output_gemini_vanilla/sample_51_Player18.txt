Okay, I'm ready to process the player commentary and generate the statistics table.

**Step-by-step breakdown:**

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player18.

2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

3.  **Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player18(Home Team)'s shot from the middle of the box is blocked by a defender after being set up by Player3(Home Team)'s cross."
        *   This snippet explicitly mentions "Player18's shot". Increment Shots count by 1.

4.  **Compile Final Counts:** Shots = 1, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player18 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
