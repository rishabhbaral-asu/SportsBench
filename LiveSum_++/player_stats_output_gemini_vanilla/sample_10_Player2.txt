Okay, let's start by identifying the target player and initializing the counts.

Target Player: Player2

Initial Counts:
*   Shots: 0
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

Now, let's analyze the commentary snippets:

Snippet 1: "Player2(Home Team)'s powerful shot from outside the box."

*   This snippet explicitly states Player2 took a shot.
*   Increment Shots: Shots = 0 + 1 = 1

Snippet 2: "Player2(Home Team)'s shot from outside the box is blocked with the help of Player9(Home Team)."

*   This snippet explicitly states Player2 took a shot, which was blocked.
*   Increment Shots: Shots = 1 + 1 = 2

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
