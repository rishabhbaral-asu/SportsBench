Okay, let's process the input step-by-step according to the instructions.

1.  **Player Name:** The target player is Player5.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Analyze Commentary Snippets:**
    *   Snippet 1: "Player5(Home Team) commits a foul."
