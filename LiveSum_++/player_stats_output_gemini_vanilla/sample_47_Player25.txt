Okay, I will follow the instructions meticulously to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the final summary table for the given player.

**1. Identify the target player:**

**2. Initialize event counts:**

*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

**3. Analyze commentary snippets:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player25(Away Team)'s left footed shot from the left side of the box is blocked after a through ball from Player26(Away Team)."
    *   The snippet explicitly states "Player25's shot".
    *   Increment Shots: Shots = 1

*   Snippet 2: "Player25(Away Team)'s shot from the left side of the box with his right foot narrowly misses to the left, assisted by Player28(Away Team)."
    *   The snippet explicitly states "Player25's shot".
