Okay, I'm ready to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the player statistics table.

**Player Name:** Player27

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player27(Away Team)'s shot from a tough angle on the left is saved in the bottom right corner after a through ball from Player28(Away Team).
- Player27(Away Team) earns a free kick on the left side of the field.
- Player27(Away Team) commits a foul.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Shots:** The first snippet explicitly states "Player27(Away Team)'s shot...is saved". This indicates one shot for Player27.
2.  **Goals:** The snippets do not explicitly state that Player27 scored a goal. Thus, the goal count remains at 0.
3.  **Assists:** The snippets do not explicitly state that Player27 provided an assist. Therefore, the assist count remains at 0.
4.  **Free Kicks:** The second snippet states "Player27(Away Team) earns a free kick...". This clearly indicates Player27 was awarded a free kick. Therefore, increment Free Kicks by 1.
5.  **Fouls:** The third snippet explicitly states "Player27(Away Team) commits a foul." This indicates one foul committed by Player27. Therefore, increment the foul count by 1.
6.  **Yellow Cards:** The snippets do not explicitly mention Player27 receiving a yellow card. Thus, the yellow card count remains at 0.
7.  **Red Cards:** The snippets do not explicitly mention Player27 receiving a red card. Thus, the red card count remains at 0.
8.  **Offsides:** The snippets do not explicitly mention Player27 being offsides. Thus, the offsides count remains at 0.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
