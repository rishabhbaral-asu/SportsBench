Okay, let's analyze the commentary snippets for Player12 and generate the statistics table.

**1. Player Identification:**
The target player is Player12.

**2. Initialization:**
Shots = 0
Goals = 0
Assists = 0
Free Kicks = 0
Fouls = 0
Yellow Cards = 0

**3. Snippet Analysis:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player12(Home Team)'s shot from outside the box is blocked with the help of Player16(Home Team)."
    *   The snippet explicitly mentions "shot" by Player12.
    *   Shots += 1

*   **Snippet 2:** "Player12(Home Team)'s attempt from outside the box with his left foot goes wide to the right, with an assist from Player9(Home Team)."
    * The snippet mentions "attempt" which falls under shot attempts.
    *   Shots += 1
    *   The snippet explicitly states Player9 provided the assist *to* Player12. This means Player12 *received* the assist, not provided it. Therefore, we do *not* increment the Assist count for Player12.
