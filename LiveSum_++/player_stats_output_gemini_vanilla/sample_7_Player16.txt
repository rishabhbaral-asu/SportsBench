Okay, let's start by identifying the target player and initializing the counts.

**Target Player:** Player16

Now, let's analyze the commentary snippets and increment the counts accordingly, following the strict counting rules.

**Commentary Snippets Analysis:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player16(Home Team)'s shot from outside the box is saved in the center of the goal, with an assist from Player9(Home Team)."
    *   `Shots`: The snippet explicitly mentions "Player16's shot", so increment Shots by 1.
    *   `Goals`: The snippet states the shot was "saved", so there is no goal.
    *   `Assists`: The snippet mentions "assist from Player9", so Player16 did not provide an assist.
    *   `Free Kicks`: No mention of free kicks or penalties.
    *   `Fouls`: No mention of fouls.
    *   `Yellow Cards`: No mention of yellow cards.
    *   `Red Cards`: No mention of red cards.
    *   `Offsides`: No mention of offsides.
