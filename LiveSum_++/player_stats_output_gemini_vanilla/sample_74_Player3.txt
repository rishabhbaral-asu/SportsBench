2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Analyze Commentary Snippets:**
    *   Snippet 1: "Player3(Home Team) earns a free kick on the left side of the field."
        *   This snippet explicitly states that Player3 earned a free kick. Therefore, Free Kicks is incremented by 1.
    *   Snippet 2: "Player3(Home Team) commits a foul, resulting in Player21(Away Team) winning a free kick in their own defensive half."
        *   This snippet explicitly states that Player3 committed a foul. Therefore, Fouls is incremented by 1.
4.  **Final Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 1, Fouls = 1, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
