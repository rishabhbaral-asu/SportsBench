Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the summary table for the specified player.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player21.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

Shots: 0
Goals: 0
Assists: 0
Free Kicks: 0
Fouls: 0
Yellow Cards: 0
Red Cards: 0
Offsides: 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player21(Away Team) fouls Player7(Home Team), awarding a free kick in the attacking half."
    *   This snippet explicitly states Player21 committed a foul.
    *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 0 + 1 = 1
    *   This snippet does not explicitly mention Player21 taking a free kick. The free kick is awarded to the opposing team as a result of the foul. So, do not increment Free Kicks.

*   **Snippet 2:** "Player21(Away Team) misses the target with a high shot from outside the box after a corner kick."
    *   This snippet explicitly states Player21 took a shot.
    *   Increment Shots: Shots = 0 + 1 = 1

**4. Final Counts:**

Shots: 1
Goals: 0
Assists: 0
Free Kicks: 0
Fouls: 1
Yellow Cards: 0
Red Cards: 0
Offsides: 0

**5. Final Summary Table:**
