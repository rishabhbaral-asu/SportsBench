Okay, let's break down the process step by step.

1. **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player26.

2. **Initialize Counts:**
   * Shots = 0
   * Goals = 0
   * Assists = 0
   * Free Kicks = 0
   * Fouls = 0
   * Yellow Cards = 0
   * Red Cards = 0
   * Offsides = 0

3. **Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

   * Snippet 1: "Player26(Away Team) misses the target with a high and wide shot from outside the box, with an assist from Player32(Away Team)."
     * Shots: The snippet explicitly states "Player26 misses the target with a ... shot". Therefore, increment Shots by 1.
     * Goals: The snippet does not state that Player26 scored a goal.
     * Assists: The snippet states "with an assist from Player32(Away Team)". This means Player26 *received* the assist, not that Player26 provided one. No assist is added for Player26.
     * Free Kicks: The snippet does not explicitly state Player26 took a free kick or was fouled.
     * Fouls: The snippet does not explicitly state Player26 committed a foul.
     * Yellow Cards: The snippet does not explicitly state Player26 received a yellow card.
     * Red Cards: The snippet does not explicitly state Player26 received a red card.
     * Offsides: The snippet does not explicitly state Player26 was offsides.

4. **Final Counts:**
   * Shots = 1
   * Goals = 0
   * Assists = 0
   * Free Kicks = 0
   * Fouls = 0
   * Yellow Cards = 0
   * Red Cards = 0
   * Offsides = 0
