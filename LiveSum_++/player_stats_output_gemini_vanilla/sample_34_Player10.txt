Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for Player10 and compile the statistics in a markdown table.

**Objective:** Analyze commentary snippets for a specific player and count explicit occurrences of defined events for that player.
    **Input:**
    * **Player Name:** The name of the single player to track.
        <PLAYER_NAME>
        Player10
        </PLAYER_NAME>
    * **Commentary Snippets:** A list of commentary text snippets potentially mentioning the player.
        <PLAYER_COMMENTARY_SNIPPETS>
        - Player10(Home Team) attempts a pass, but Player5(Home Team) is offside.
        </PLAYER_COMMENTARY_SNIPPETS>

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1.  **Player Name:** The target player is Player10.
2.  **Initialization:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Snippet Analysis:**

    *   Snippet 1: "Player10(Home Team) attempts a pass, but Player5(Home Team) is offside."
        *   Player10 is explicitly mentioned.
        *   This snippet describes a pass by Player10 that led to Player5 being offside. The pass does *not* directly lead to a goal. Thus, this is **not** an assist. There are no mentions of Shots, Goals, Fouls, Yellow/Red Cards, or Free Kicks in this snippet. The snippet only says that Player5 is offside, not Player10.
        * The snippet does not contain keywords relating to shots, goals, assists, free kicks, fouls, or cards.

4.  **Final Counts:**
    * Shots: 0
    * Goals: 0
    * Assists: 0
    * Free Kicks: 0
    * Fouls: 0
    * Yellow Cards: 0
    * Red Cards: 0
    * Offsides: 0
