Okay, let's process the input and generate the final summary table.

**Objective:** Analyze commentary snippets for a specific player and count explicit occurrences of defined events for that player.

**Input:**
*   **Player Name:**
    ```
    <PLAYER_NAME>
    Player23
    </PLAYER_NAME>
    ```
*   **Commentary Snippets:**
    ```
    <PLAYER_COMMENTARY_SNIPPETS>
    - Player23(Away Team) attempts a pass to Player28(Away Team), but Player28(Away Team) is in an offside position.
    </PLAYER_COMMENTARY_SNIPPETS>
    ```

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

1.  **Player Identification:** The target player is Player23.

2.  **Initialization:** Initialize all event counts to 0: Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

3.  **Snippet Analysis:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player23(Away Team) attempts a pass to Player28(Away Team), but Player28(Away Team) is in an offside position."
        *   This snippet describes Player23 attempting a pass, but it doesn't explicitly state that the pass led to a goal. Therefore, no assist is recorded. Also, Player23 is not offside, Player28 is.
        * No shots, goals, free kicks, fouls, yellow cards or red cards are mentioned.

4.  **Final Counts:**
    *   Shots: 0
    *   Goals: 0
    *   Assists: 0
    *   Free Kicks: 0
    *   Fouls: 0
    *   Yellow Cards: 0
    *   Red Cards: 0
    *   Offsides: 0

**Final Summary Table:**
