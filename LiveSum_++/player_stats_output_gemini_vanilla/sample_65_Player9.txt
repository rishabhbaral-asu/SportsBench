Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for Player9 and compile the statistics in a markdown table.

1.  **Identify the target player:**
    The target player is Player9.

2.  **Initialize Counts:**
    Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0

3.  **Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player9(Home Team)'s shot from the left side of the box is saved in the bottom right corner with an assist from Player3(Home Team)."
        *   The snippet explicitly states "Player9's shot". Therefore, increment Shots by 1.
        *   The snippet mentions an assist from Player3, not Player9. Therefore, Assists remains 0.

    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player9(Home Team) of the Home Team was caught offside after Player2(Home Team) attempted to send a through ball."
        *   The snippet explicitly states "Player9 was caught offside". Therefore, increment Offsides by 1.

    *   **Snippet 3:** "Player9(Home Team) misses the target with a right-footed shot from the center of the box, with an assist from Player10(Home Team)."
        *   The snippet explicitly states "Player9 misses the target with a shot". Therefore, increment Shots by 1.
        *   The snippet mentions an assist from Player10, not Player9. Therefore, Assists remains 0.

4.  **Final Counts:**
    Shots = 2, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 1

Final Summary Table:
