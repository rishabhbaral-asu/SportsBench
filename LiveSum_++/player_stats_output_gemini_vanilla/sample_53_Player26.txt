Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the final summary table for the specified player.

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player26.

2.  **Initialize Counts:**
    * Shots: 0
    * Goals: 0
    * Assists: 0
    * Free Kicks: 0
    * Fouls: 0
    * Yellow Cards: 0
    * Red Cards: 0
    * Offsides: 0

3.  **Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

    *   Snippet 1: "Player26(Away Team) attempts a through ball, but Player28(Away Team) is offside for the Away Team."
        *   This snippet mentions Player26 attempting a through ball. It doesn't say the through ball led to a goal, or that it resulted in an assist for Player26. It resulted in player Player28 being offside, which will be counted for the offside statistic and added to Player28. Since it wasn't a free kick, shot, foul or card, and is just a pass that does not lead to a goal, nothing is added.

4.  **Compile Final Counts:**
    * Shots: 0
    * Goals: 0
    * Assists: 0
    * Free Kicks: 0
    * Fouls: 0
    * Yellow Cards: 0
    * Red Cards: 0
    * Offsides: 0

Final Summary Table:
