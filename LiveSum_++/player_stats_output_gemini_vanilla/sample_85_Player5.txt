Okay, I will analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and provide the final summary table.

**Objective:** Analyze commentary snippets for a specific player and count explicit occurrences of defined events for that player.

**Input:**
* **Player Name:**
```text
<PLAYER_NAME>
Player5
</PLAYER_NAME>
```
* **Commentary Snippets:**
```text
<PLAYER_COMMENTARY_SNIPPETS>
- Player5(Home Team) fouls Player27(Away Team) to give away a free kick on the left wing.
- Player5(Home Team) missed the shot from long range with his right foot, it went high and wide to the left, assisted by Player14(Home Team).
</PLAYER_COMMENTARY_SNIPPETS>
```

**Analysis:**

1.  **Player Name:** The target player is Player5.
2.  **Initialization:** Initialize all counts to 0 for Player5. Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Snippet Analysis:**
    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player5(Home Team) fouls Player27(Away Team) to give away a free kick on the left wing."
        *   The snippet explicitly states Player5 committed a foul. Increment Fouls by 1.
    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player5(Home Team) missed the shot from long range with his right foot, it went high and wide to the left, assisted by Player14(Home Team)."
        *   The snippet explicitly mentions Player5 missed a shot. Increment Shots by 1.
        *   This snippet contains "assisted by Player14", meaning Player5 did NOT provide an assist, so the assist count remains 0.

4.  **Final Counts:**
    *   Shots: 1
    *   Goals: 0
    *   Assists: 0
    *   Free Kicks: 0
    *   Fouls: 1
    *   Yellow Cards: 0
    *   Red Cards: 0
    *   Offsides: 0
