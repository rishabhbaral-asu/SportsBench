Okay, let's analyze the commentary snippets for Player21 and generate the statistics table.

**1. Player Name:**
`<PLAYER_NAME>`
`Player21`
`</PLAYER_NAME>`
The target player is Player21.

**2. Initialization:**
Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0

**3. Snippet Analysis:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player21(Away Team) of the Away Team attempts a through ball to Player28(Away Team), but he is caught offside, Player9(Home Team) takes a left-footed shot from the center of the box, but it is saved by the goalkeeper, with an assist from Player10(Home Team)."
    *   This snippet mentions Player21 attempting a through ball, but it doesn't lead to a goal. The through ball attempt doesn't count as a shot. Player28 is caught offside, so that is an offside for them and does not apply to Player21. Player9 takes a shot, and Player10 provides an assist, but neither of these count towards Player21's stats.
    *   Offsides = 0 (Player21 not explicitly offside)

*   **Snippet 2:** "Player21(Away Team) commits a foul."
    *   This snippet explicitly states that Player21 commits a foul.
    *   Fouls = 1

**4. Final Counts:**

*   Shots: 0
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 1
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

**Final Summary Table:**
