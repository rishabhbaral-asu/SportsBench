Okay, let's start by identifying the target player and initializing the counts.

**Target Player:** Player21

**Initial Counts:**
*   Shots: 0
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

Now, let's analyze the commentary snippets:

**Snippet 1:** "Player21(Away Team)'s left footed shot from the left side of the box following a corner goes over the goal."

*   This snippet explicitly mentions "shot" by Player21. Therefore, increment the Shots count.

**Updated Counts:**
*   Shots: 1
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0
