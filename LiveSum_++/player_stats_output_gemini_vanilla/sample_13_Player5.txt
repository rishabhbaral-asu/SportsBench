Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the markdown table with the counts of each event.

**Player Name:** Player5

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player5(Home Team), receives a yellow card.

**Reasoning:**

1.  The target player is Player5.
2.  Initialize all counts to 0: Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  Analyze the snippet: "Player5(Home Team), receives a yellow card."
    *   Yellow Cards: The snippet explicitly states "Player5 receives a yellow card," so increment Yellow Cards by 1.

4.  Final Counts: Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 1, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

**Final Summary Table:**
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player5 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 0     | 1            | 0         | 0        |
