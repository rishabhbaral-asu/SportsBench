Okay, let's start by identifying the target player and initializing the counts for each event.

**Target Player:** Player11

Now, let's initialize the counts for each event to 0.

*   Shots: 0
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

Next, we will analyze each commentary snippet and increment the counts based on the defined keywords and the **Absolute Strict Counting & Unambiguous Attribution** rule.

**Snippet 1:** "Player11(Home Team) commits a foul."

*   This snippet explicitly states that Player11 committed a foul. Therefore, increment the 'Fouls' count by 1.
    *   Fouls: 1

**Snippet 2:** "Player11(Home Team)'s shot from outside the box is blocked with the help of Player7(Home Team)."

*   This snippet mentions Player11's shot. Therefore, increment the 'Shots' count by 1.
    *   Shots: 1

**Snippet 3:** "Player11(Home Team) commits a foul."

*   This snippet explicitly states that Player11 committed a foul. Therefore, increment the 'Fouls' count by 1.
    *   Fouls: 2

Now that we have analyzed all the snippets, let's create the final summary table.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player11 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 2     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
