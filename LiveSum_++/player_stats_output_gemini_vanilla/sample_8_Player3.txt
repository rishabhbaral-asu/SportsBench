Okay, let's start by identifying the target player.

The target player is Player3.

Now, let's initialize the counts for Player3: Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

Now, we will analyze each snippet:

Snippet 1: "Player3(Home Team) earns a free kick from the left side."
*   Free Kicks: Player3 earns a free kick, so Free Kicks = 1.

Snippet 2: "Player3(Home Team)'s shot from outside the box with his right foot narrowly misses to the left, following a corner kick from Player10(Home Team)."
*   Shots: Player3 takes a shot, so Shots = 1.

Now, let's create the final summary table.

Final Summary Table:
