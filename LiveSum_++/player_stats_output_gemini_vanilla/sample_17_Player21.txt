Okay, I'm ready to process the input and generate the player statistics table.

*   Offsides = 0

**3. Analyze commentary snippets:**

    *   Player21 `yellow card`: Increment Yellow Cards count.
*   **Snippet 4:** "Player21(Away Team) commits a foul, resulting in Player9(Home Team) winning a free kick in their own defensive half, This leads to a free kick for Player9(Home Team) in their defensive half."
    *   Player21 `foul`: Increment Fouls count.
*   **Snippet 5:** "Player21(Away Team) commits a foul."
