Okay, let's start by identifying the player name and initializing the counts.

Player Name: Player28

Now, let's initialize the event counts to 0: Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

Now, let's analyze the commentary snippets and increment the counts based on the instructions.

Commentary Snippet 1: "Player28(Away Team)'s right footed shot from outside the box narrowly misses to the right."

This snippet mentions "shot" explicitly attributed to Player28. Therefore, increment Shots by 1.

Current counts: Shots = 1, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player28 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
