**Commentary Snippets:**

*   Player7(Home Team) earns a free kick in their own half.
*   Player7(Home Team)'s shot from the left side of the box is blocked by the defense after being assisted by Player9(Home Team).

**Analysis:**

1.  **Free Kicks:** The first snippet states "Player7(Home Team) earns a free kick in their own half." This explicitly states that the player earned a free kick. Therefore, the 'Free Kicks' count should be incremented by 1.
2.  **Shots:** The second snippet states "Player7(Home Team)'s shot from the left side of the box is blocked by the defense after being assisted by Player9(Home Team)." This explicitly says Player7 took a shot. Therefore, the 'Shots' count should be incremented by 1.
3.  **Goals:** Neither snippet mentions Player7 scoring a goal.
4.  **Assists:** Neither snippet indicates that Player7 provided an assist to a goal. The second snippet explicitly states that Player7 was *assisted by* Player9; therefore, we do NOT count an assist for Player7.
