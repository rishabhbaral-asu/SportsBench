Okay, let's start by identifying the player name from the input.

*   **Player Name:** Player1

Now, let's initialize the counts for all events to 0.

Next, I will go through the commentary snippets and increment the counts based on the instructions.

**Commentary Snippets Analysis:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player1(Home Team) is injured, ."
    *   This snippet mentions Player1 is injured but doesn't explicitly mention any of the tracked events (Shots, Goals, Assists, Free Kicks, Fouls, Yellow Cards, Red Cards, or Offsides). Therefore, no counts are incremented.

**Final Summary Table:**

```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player1 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
