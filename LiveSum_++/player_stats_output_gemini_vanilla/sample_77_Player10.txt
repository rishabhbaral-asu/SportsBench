Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for Player10 and compile the statistics in a markdown table.

**Player Name:** Player10

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player10(Home Team)'s shot from the center of the box is blocked with his right foot, after being assisted by Player2(Home Team).

2.  **Analyze Snippets:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player10(Home Team)'s shot from the center of the box is blocked with his right foot, after being assisted by Player2(Home Team)."
        *   This snippet explicitly mentions "shot" by Player10, so increment Shots by 1.
        *   It does not explicitly mention a goal.
        *   It mentions Player10 was *assisted by* Player2, not the other way around. Thus no assist to count for Player10.

    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player10(Home Team) earns a free kick in the opponent's half."
        *   This snippet explicitly mentions Player10 earning a "free kick", so increment Free Kicks by 1.

3. **Final Counts:**
    *   Shots: 1
    *   Goals: 0
    *   Assists: 0
    *   Free Kicks: 1
    *   Fouls: 0
    *   Yellow Cards: 0
    *   Red Cards: 0
    *   Offsides: 0
