Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the player statistics table.

**Begin Analysis**

1.  **Player Name:** The target player is Player21.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Analyze Snippets:**
    *   Snippet 1: "Player21(Away Team) commits a foul." - This explicitly states Player21 committed a foul. Therefore, increment Fouls by 1. Fouls = 1

4.  **Final Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 1, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player21 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 1     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
