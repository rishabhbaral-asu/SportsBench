Okay, let's start by identifying the player and initializing the counts.

Player Name: Player1

Initial Counts:
*   Shots: 0
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

Now, analyze each snippet and increment the counts accordingly.

Snippet 1: "Player1(Home Team) attempts a through ball, but Player9(Home Team) is caught offside."
* No goals, assists, fouls, or cards here. The snippet does not explicitly mention a shot or a free kick, so no increments are made in those categories. It doesn't say Player1 was offside.

Snippet 2: "Player1(Home Team) attempts a through ball, but Player17(Home Team) is caught offside."
* No goals, assists, fouls, or cards here. The snippet does not explicitly mention a shot or a free kick, so no increments are made in those categories. It doesn't say Player1 was offside.

Final Summary Table:
