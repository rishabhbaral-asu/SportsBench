Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for Player1 and generate the summary table.

1.  **Player Name:** Player1

2.  **Initialization:**
    *   Shots = 0
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 0
    *   Fouls = 0
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0

3.  **Commentary Snippet Analysis:**
    *   Snippet 1: "Player1(Home Team) attempts a through ball, but Player9(Home Team) is caught offside."
        *   Player1 attempts a through ball: This is not a shot, goal, free kick, or assist based on the keywords. Player9 is offside but Player1 is not. So Offsides = 0.

4. **Final Summary Table:**
