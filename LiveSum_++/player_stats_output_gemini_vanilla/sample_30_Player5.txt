Okay, let's start by extracting the player name from the input. The player name is Player5.
Now, initialize the counts for all events to 0.

Next, I'll analyze each commentary snippet and increment the counts accordingly, following the given definitions and keywords.

Snippet 1: "Player5(Home Team)'s header from a cross by Player3(Home Team)."
This mentions a "header", which can be a shot. Since it is Player5's header, it is a shot. Increment Shots by 1.

Snippet 2: "Player5(Home Team) commits a foul."
This explicitly states that Player5 commits a foul. Increment Fouls by 1.

Snippet 3: "Player5(Home Team)'s shot from the center of the box is saved by the goalkeeper after a cross from Player15(Home Team)."
This explicitly states that Player5 took a shot, and it was saved. Increment Shots by 1.

Now, let's create the final summary table.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player5 | 2     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 1     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
