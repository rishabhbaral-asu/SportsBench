Okay, let's start by identifying the player name and initializing the counts.

Player Name: Player3

Now, I will analyze the commentary snippets and increment the counts based on the instructions.

Commentary Snippet 1: "Player3(Home Team) is awarded a free kick in the opponent's half, ."

*   Free Kicks: The snippet mentions "Player3 is awarded a free kick". This implies Player3 wins a free kick. So, Free Kicks count is incremented by 1.

Commentary Snippet 2: "Player3(Home Team) earns a free kick in their own half."

*   Free Kicks: The snippet mentions "Player3 earns a free kick". This implies Player3 wins a free kick. So, Free Kicks count is incremented by 1.

Now, let's compile the final summary table.
