Okay, I will follow the instructions meticulously to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the final summary table for the specified player.

**Player Name:**
Player15

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player15(Home Team) has committed a hand ball.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player15.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Analyze Snippets:**
    *   Snippet 1: "Player15(Home Team) has committed a hand ball."
        *   The snippet explicitly states "Player15" committed a "hand ball". This is considered a foul. Increment Fouls count by 1.
4.  **Final Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 1, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

Final Summary Table:
