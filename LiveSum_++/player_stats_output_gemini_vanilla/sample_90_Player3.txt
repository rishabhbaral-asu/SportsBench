Okay, let's analyze the commentary snippets for Player3 and generate the statistics table.

**Step 1: Identify the target player.**

The target player is Player3.

**Step 2: Initialize counts.**

Shots = 0
Goals = 0
Assists = 0
Free Kicks = 0
Fouls = 0
Yellow Cards = 0
Red Cards = 0
Offsides = 0

**Step 3: Analyze each snippet and increment counts based on the rules.**

*   **Snippet 1: Player3(Home Team) earns a free kick in their own half.**

    *   This snippet indicates Player3 earned a free kick. Therefore, increment Free Kicks.

    Free Kicks = 1

*   **Snippet 2: Player3(Home Team) of the Home Team attempts a through ball, but Player9(Home Team) is offside.**

    *   This snippet indicates Player3 *attempted* a through ball, but it does not say anything about goals, shots, or assists. The offside is on Player9, not Player3.

*   **Snippet 3: Player3(Home Team)'s header from the center of the box to the top right corner after a set piece.**

    *   This snippet describes Player3 attempting a header from the center of the box to the top right corner. Therefore, increment shots. Since it doesn't say if the header was on target, saved, blocked or went wide, we only increment shots.

    Shots = 1

**Step 4: Construct the final summary table.**

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player3 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 1          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
