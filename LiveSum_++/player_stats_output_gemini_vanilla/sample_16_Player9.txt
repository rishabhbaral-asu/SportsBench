Okay, I'm ready to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the player statistics table.

**Step-by-step breakdown:**

1.  **Identify Target Player:**
    *   The target player is Player9.

2.  **Initialize Counts:**
    *   Shots = 0
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 0
    *   Fouls = 0
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0

3.  **Analyze Snippets:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player9(Home Team)'s left-footed shot from the left side of the box is saved in the bottom right corner with an assist from Player11(Home Team)."
        *   Mentions "shot" explicitly attributed to Player9. Therefore, Shots += 1.
        *   Mentions "assist from Player11", Player9 is not giving the assist, therefore, Assists remains 0.

    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player9(Home Team) misses a header to the left from the center of the box after a cross from Player10(Home Team) following a corner."
        *   Mentions "header" and "misses" indicating an attempt on goal is made by the target player. Therefore Shots += 1.

4.  **Final Counts:**

    *   Shots = 2
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 0
    *   Fouls = 0
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player9 | 2     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
