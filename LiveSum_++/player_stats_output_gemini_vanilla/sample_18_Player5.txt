    * Snippet 1: "Player5(Home Team) commits a foul, resulting in Player34(Away Team) winning a free kick on the left wing, ."
        * This snippet explicitly states that Player5 commits a foul. Therefore, increment the Fouls count by 1.
        * The same snippet mentions that Player5 commits a foul, and as a result Player34 wins a free kick. The rule states that if the player *wins* a free kick or penalty due to an action by another player, or because they are fouled, this counts as a free kick. Here Player5 *commits* a foul leading to the free kick, so the definition does not cover this event for the player, and no free kick is incremented.
