Okay, I'm ready to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the markdown table.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player4.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Analyze Snippets:**
    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player4(Home Team) commits a foul."
        *   The snippet explicitly states that Player4 committed a foul.
        *   Increment Fouls count: Fouls = 1.
    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player4(Home Team) concedes a penalty after fouling Player25(Away Team) in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty for the Away Team."
        *   The snippet explicitly states that Player4 committed a foul, resulting in a penalty.
        *   Increment Fouls count: Fouls = 2.
4.  **Final Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 2, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player4 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 2     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
