Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the markdown table with the player's statistics.

**1. Identify the target player name:**

The target player name is Player35.

**2. Initialize counts:**

*   Shots = 0
*   Goals = 0
*   Assists = 0
*   Free Kicks = 0
*   Fouls = 0
*   Yellow Cards = 0
*   Red Cards = 0
*   Offsides = 0

**3. Analyze each snippet:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player35(Away Team) commits a foul, resulting in Player5(Home Team) winning a free kick in their defensive half."
    *   "commits a foul": Increment Fouls by 1.
    *   "winning a free kick": No, this refers to Player5 not Player35, so no increment for free kicks.
*   **Snippet 2:** "Player35(Away Team) commits a foul."
    *   "commits a foul": Increment Fouls by 1.

**4. Final Counts:**

*   Shots = 0
*   Goals = 0
*   Assists = 0
*   Free Kicks = 0
*   Fouls = 2
*   Yellow Cards = 0
*   Red Cards = 0
*   Offsides = 0

**5. Create the markdown table:**

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player35 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 2     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
