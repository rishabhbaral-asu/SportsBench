Okay, I'm ready to analyze the commentary snippets and compile the player statistics.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player26.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

Shots: 0
Goals: 0
Assists: 0
Free Kicks: 0
Fouls: 0
Yellow Cards: 0
Red Cards: 0
Offsides: 0

**3. Analyze Snippets:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player26(Away Team) Bo-Kyung attempts a through ball to Player20(Away Team), who is caught offside."
    *   Offsides: Player20 is offside, not Player26. Player26 *attempts* a through ball but this does not fit into the definition of any of the keywords.
*   Snippet 2: "Player26(Away Team) earns a free kick in the opponent's half."
    *   Free Kicks: Player26 "earns a free kick" which falls under the "wins a free kick" keyword for Free Kicks (taken). Increment Free Kicks by 1.
*   Snippet 3: "Player26(Away Team) commits a foul."
    *   Fouls: Player26 "commits a foul". Increment Fouls by 1.
*   Snippet 4: "Player26(Away Team) commits a foul, resulting in Player3(Home Team) winning a free kick in their defensive half."
    *   Fouls: Player26 "commits a foul". Increment Fouls by 1.

**4. Final Counts:**

Shots: 0
Goals: 0
Assists: 0
Free Kicks: 1
Fouls: 2
Yellow Cards: 0
Red Cards: 0
Offsides: 0
