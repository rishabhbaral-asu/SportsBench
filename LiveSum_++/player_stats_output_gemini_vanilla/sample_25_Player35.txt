Okay, let's start.

1.  **Identify the target player:** The target player is Player35.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Analyze Snippets:**
    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player35(Away Team)'s shot from the right side of the box is saved by the goalkeeper, with an assist from Player20(Away Team)."
        *   `shot`: The snippet explicitly states "Player35's shot", so Shots = 1.
        *   `assist`: Player35 is assisted by Player20, so no assist is counted for Player35.
    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player35(Away Team)'s shot from outside the box is blocked after being set up by Player22(Away Team)."
        *   `shot`: The snippet explicitly states "Player35's shot", so Shots = 1+1 = 2.
        *   `assist`: Player35 is set up by Player22, so no assist is counted for Player35.

4.  **Final Counts:** Shots = 2, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0
