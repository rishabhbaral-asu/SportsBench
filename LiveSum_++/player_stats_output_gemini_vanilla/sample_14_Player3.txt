Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for Player3 and generate the final summary table.

1.  **Identify the target player:** The target player is Player3.
2.  **Initialize counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

3.  **Analyze each snippet:**

    *   Snippet 1: "Player3(Home Team) commits a foul on Player28(Away Team), who then wins a free kick on the right wing."
        *   Player3 commits a foul. Increment Fouls by 1.
        *   Player3's foul results in Player28 winning a free kick - this does not count as a free kick *taken* by Player3.
    *   Snippet 2: "Player3(Home Team) receives a yellow card for a rough tackle."
        *   Player3 receives a yellow card. Increment Yellow Cards by 1.
    *   Snippet 3: "Player3(Home Team)'s shot from outside the box is saved in the bottom left corner after an assist from Player4(Home Team)."
        *   Player3's shot is saved. Increment Shots by 1.

4.  **Final Counts:** Shots = 1, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 1, Yellow Cards = 1, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
