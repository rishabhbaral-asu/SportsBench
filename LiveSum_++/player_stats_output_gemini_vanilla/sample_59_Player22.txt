Okay, let's start by identifying the player name. The player name is Player22.

Now, I will initialize the counts for all the events to 0.

Next, I will analyze each commentary snippet and increment the counts for the events attributed to Player22.

**Commentary Snippet 1:** "Player22(Away Team) from the Away Team has scored an own goal, giving the Home Team a 1-0 lead."

*   **Shots:** An own goal is considered a shot. Increment Shots by 1.
*   **Goals:** Player22 scored (an own goal, but a goal nonetheless). Increment Goals by 1.
*   **Assists:** No assist mentioned.
*   **Free Kicks:** No free kick mentioned.
*   **Fouls:** No foul mentioned.
*   **Yellow Cards:** No yellow card mentioned.
*   **Red Cards:** No red card mentioned.
*   **Offsides:** No offside mentioned.

Now, I will generate the final summary table.
