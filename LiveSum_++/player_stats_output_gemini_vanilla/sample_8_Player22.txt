Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the final summary table.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player22.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

*   Shots = 0
*   Goals = 0
*   Assists = 0
*   Free Kicks = 0
*   Fouls = 0
*   Yellow Cards = 0
*   Red Cards = 0
*   Offsides = 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   Snippet 1: "Player22(Away Team)'s shot from the center of the box is blocked by the defense, with an assist from Player31(Away Team)."
    *   The snippet explicitly states "Player22's shot". Therefore, increment Shots by 1.
    *   The snippet does *not* state that Player22 scored a goal.
    *   The snippet explicitly says the assist came from "Player31". Therefore, no assist is attributed to Player22.
    *   No mention of free kicks, fouls, or cards.
    *   No mention of offsides.

**4. Final Counts:**

*   Shots = 1
*   Goals = 0
*   Assists = 0
*   Free Kicks = 0
*   Fouls = 0
*   Yellow Cards = 0
*   Red Cards = 0
*   Offsides = 0
