Okay, let's break this down step-by-step.

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player26.

2.  **Initialize Counts:**
    *   Shots = 0
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 0
    *   Fouls = 0
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0

3.  **Analyze Snippets:**

    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player26(Away Team) earns a free kick in their own half after being fouled by Player10(Home Team)."
        *   This snippet explicitly states Player26 "earns a free kick." This maps to the "Free Kicks (taken)" event. Increment Free Kicks by 1.
        *   Free Kicks = 1

    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player26(Away Team)'s attempt from outside the box is blocked, resulting in a corner kick for the Away Team."
        *   This snippet explicitly states Player26 made an "attempt...is blocked". This is a shot. Increment Shots by 1.
        *   Shots = 1

4.  **Final Counts:**
    *   Shots = 1
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 1
    *   Fouls = 0
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0
