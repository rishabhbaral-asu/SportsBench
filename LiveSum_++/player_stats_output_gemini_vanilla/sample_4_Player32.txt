Okay, I'm ready to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the player statistics table.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player32.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

*   Shots = 0
*   Goals = 0
*   Assists = 0
*   Free Kicks = 0
*   Fouls = 0
*   Yellow Cards = 0
*   Red Cards = 0
*   Offsides = 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player32(Away Team) commits a foul."
    *   This snippet explicitly states Player32 committed a foul.
    *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 0 + 1 = 1

*   **Snippet 2:** "Player32(Away Team)'s right footed shot from outside the box is blocked with an assist from Player26(Away Team), while Player25(Away Team)'s shot from the right side is high and wide to the left."
    *   This snippet explicitly states Player32 took a shot.
    *   Increment Shots: Shots = 0 + 1 = 1
    *   This snippet explicitly states Player32 was assisted by Player26, which is irrelevant for the target Player32 because Player32 did not provide the assist.

*   **Snippet 3:** "Player32(Away Team) earns a free kick in the attacking half after a foul by Player10(Home Team)."
    *   This snippet explicitly states Player32 earned a free kick.
    *   Increment Free Kicks: Free Kicks = 0 + 1 = 1

**4. Final Counts:**

*   Shots = 1
*   Goals = 0
*   Assists = 0
*   Free Kicks = 1
*   Fouls = 1
*   Yellow Cards = 0
*   Red Cards = 0
*   Offsides = 0

**5. Final Summary Table:**

```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player32 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 1          | 1     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
