Okay, I'm ready to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the player statistics table.

**Player Name:** Player5

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player5(Home Team)'s long-range left-footed shot is blocked.
- Player5(Home Team) commits a foul on Player27(Away Team), resulting in a free kick being awarded on the right wing.
- Player5(Home Team) commits a foul, leading to Player27(Away Team) winning a free kick in their own defensive half, This results in a set piece opportunity for Player27(Away Team).

**Step-by-step analysis:**

1.  **Shots:** The first snippet mentions "Player5(Home Team)'s long-range left-footed shot is blocked". This is an explicit shot attempt by Player5, so Shots = 1.
2.  **Goals:** No snippet explicitly states Player5 scored a goal. So, Goals = 0.
3.  **Assists:** No snippet explicitly states Player5 provided an assist. So, Assists = 0.
4.  **Free Kicks (Taken):** No snippet mentions Player5 taking a free kick or penalty. The second and third snippets mention Player5 committing a foul that resulted in a free kick for the opposing team, but Player5 did not *take* the free kick. So, Free Kicks = 0.
5.  **Fouls (Committed):** The second and third snippets explicitly state "Player5(Home Team) commits a foul". Therefore, Fouls = 2.
6.  **Yellow Cards:** No snippet explicitly mentions Player5 receiving a yellow card. So, Yellow Cards = 0.
7.  **Red Cards:** No snippet explicitly mentions Player5 receiving a red card. So, Red Cards = 0.
8.  **Offsides:** No snippet explicitly mentions Player5 being offside. So, Offsides = 0.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
