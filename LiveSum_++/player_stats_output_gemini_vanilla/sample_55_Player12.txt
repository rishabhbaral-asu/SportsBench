Okay, I'm ready to process the player commentary snippets and generate the markdown table.

**Player Name:** Player12

**Commentary Snippets:**

*   Player12(Home Team) earns a free kick in the opponent's half after being fouled by Player26(Away Team).
*   Player12(Home Team) earns a free kick in the opponent's half.
*   Player12(Home Team) attempts a through ball, but Player4(Home Team) is caught in an offside position.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Player Name:** The target player is Player12.
2.  **Initialization:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Snippet 1 Analysis:** "Player12(Home Team) earns a free kick in the opponent's half after being fouled by Player26(Away Team)." This clearly states Player12 earned a free kick, which counts as a Free Kick (taken). Free Kicks = 1.
4.  **Snippet 2 Analysis:** "Player12(Home Team) earns a free kick in the opponent's half." This clearly states Player12 earned a free kick, which counts as a Free Kick (taken). Free Kicks = 2.
5.  **Snippet 3 Analysis:** "Player12(Home Team) attempts a through ball, but Player4(Home Team) is caught in an offside position." This clearly states Player12 attempted a pass that led to Player4 being offside. This does NOT count as an assist for Player12. Offsides = 0.

**Final Summary Table:**
