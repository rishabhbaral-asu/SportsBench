Okay, let's process the input step by step to generate the player statistics table.

1.  **Identify Target Player:**
    The target player is Player35.

2.  **Initialize Counts:**
    *   Shots = 0
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 0
    *   Fouls = 0
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0

3.  **Analyze Commentary Snippets:**
    *   Snippet 1: "Player35(Away Team) commits a foul, resulting in Player14(Home Team) winning a free kick on the right wing, ."
        *   This snippet explicitly states "Player35 commits a foul". Increment Fouls by 1.
        *   The snippet also states that Player14 wins a free kick as a *result* of the foul by Player35, this statement does not imply Player35 taking a free kick so the "Free Kicks" count stays at zero.

4.  **Compile Final Counts:**
    *   Shots = 0
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 0
    *   Fouls = 1
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player35 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 1     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
