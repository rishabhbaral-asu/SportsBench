Okay, let's process the input step-by-step.

1.  **Player Name:** The target player is Player2.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** We start with all event counts for Player2 set to 0.

Now, let's analyze the commentary snippets:

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player2(Home Team) attempts a pass to Player7(Home Team), who is caught offside."
    *   This snippet mentions an offside, but it's Player7 who is offside, not Player2. It also mentions a pass attempt, but not explicitly one that leads to a goal (an assist). No events are attributed to Player2 in this snippet based on the provided definitions.
    * Offsides = 0
    * Assists = 0

*   **Snippet 2:** "Player2(Home Team)'s shot from outside the box with his right foot goes wide left."
    *   This snippet explicitly states Player2 took a shot.
    *   Shots = 1
    *   Goals = 0

Now, let's construct the final summary table.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player2 | 1     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
