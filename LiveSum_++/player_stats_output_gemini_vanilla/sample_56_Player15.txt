Okay, let's analyze the commentary snippets for Player15 and generate the requested markdown table.

**1. Player Identification:**

The target player is Player15.

**2. Initialization:**

We initialize all event counters to 0: Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

**3. Snippet Analysis:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player15(Home Team) earns a free kick in their own half."

    *   This snippet explicitly states that Player15 *earns* a free kick. This implies that Player15 was fouled. Thus, we increment the 'Free Kicks' counter.

*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 1
