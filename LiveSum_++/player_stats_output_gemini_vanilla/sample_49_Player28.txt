Okay, let's start by identifying the player and initializing the counts.

Player Name: Player28

Now I will go through each snippet and increment the counts accordingly.

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player28(Away Team) earns a free kick in the opponent's half."
    *   This indicates Player28 won a free kick. Increment Free Kicks by 1.
*   **Snippet 2:** "Player28(Away Team) earns a free kick in their own half."
    *   This indicates Player28 won a free kick. Increment Free Kicks by 1.
*   **Snippet 3:** "Player28(Away Team)'s shot from outside the box is saved in the middle of the goal with the help of Player29(Away Team)."
    *   This indicates Player28 took a shot. Increment Shots by 1.
*   **Snippet 4:** "Player28(Away Team)'s header from the left side of the six-yard box misses to the left, with an assist from Player22(Away Team)."
    *   This indicates Player28 took a shot (header). Increment Shots by 1. Since Player28 *received* an assist, do not add to Player28's assists.

Final counts:

*   Shots: 2
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 2
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
