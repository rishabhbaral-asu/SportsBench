Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the markdown table.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player11.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

*   Shots: 0
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player11(Home Team)'s shot from the left side of the box is blocked after being assisted by Player2(Home Team) with a cross."
    *   This snippet mentions "shot" explicitly attributed to Player11.
    *   Increment Shots: Shots = 0 + 1 = 1

*   **Snippet 2:** "Player11(Home Team)'s right-footed shot from outside the box into the bottom left corner."
    *   This snippet implies a goal, as the ball goes into the "bottom left corner". However, it does *not explicitly* say "goal" or "scores." Therefore, it only counts as a shot.
    *   Increment Shots: Shots = 1 + 1 = 2

*   **Snippet 3:** "Player11(Home Team) commits a foul."
    *   This snippet mentions "foul" explicitly attributed to Player11.
    *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 0 + 1 = 1

**4. Final Counts:**

*   Shots: 2
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 1
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player11 | 2     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 1     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
