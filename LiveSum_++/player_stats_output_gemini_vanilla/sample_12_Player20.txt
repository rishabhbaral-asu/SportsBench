Okay, let's start.

First, I identify the player name: Player20.

Then I initialize all counters to 0.

Now I will read each commentary snippet and increment the appropriate counters *only* when the action is explicitly and unambiguously attributed to Player20.

**Snippet 1:** "Player20(Away Team) commits a foul."

*   Fouls: Increment by 1 (explicitly states Player20 commits a foul).

**Snippet 2:** "Player20(Away Team) commits a foul."

*   Fouls: Increment by 1 (explicitly states Player20 commits a foul).

**Snippet 3:** "Player20(Away Team) receives a yellow card for a rough challenge."

*   Yellow Cards: Increment by 1 (explicitly states Player20 received a yellow card).

Now I present the final summary table.

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player20 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 2     | 1            | 0         | 0        |
```
