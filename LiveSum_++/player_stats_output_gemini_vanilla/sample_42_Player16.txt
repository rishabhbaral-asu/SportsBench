Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the summary table.

1.  **Player Name:** The target player is Player16.
2.  **Initialization:** I initialize the counts for all events to 0.

3.  **Snippet Analysis:**
    *   **Snippet 1:** "Player16(Home Team) scores with a right footed shot from outside the box to level the score at 1-1 between the Home Team and the Away Team."
        *   The snippet explicitly states Player16 scores. Therefore, Goals += 1.
        *   The snippet explicitly states Player16 took a shot. Therefore, Shots += 1.
    *   **Snippet 2:** "Player16(Home Team) earns a free kick on the left side of the field."
        *   The snippet explicitly states Player16 earned a free kick. Therefore Free Kicks += 1

4.  **Final Counts:**
    *   Shots: 1
    *   Goals: 1
    *   Assists: 0
    *   Free Kicks: 1
    *   Fouls: 0
    *   Yellow Cards: 0
    *   Red Cards: 0
    *   Offsides: 0

Final Summary Table:
