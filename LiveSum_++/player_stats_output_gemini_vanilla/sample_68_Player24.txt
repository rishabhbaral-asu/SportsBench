Okay, let's analyze the commentary snippets for Player24 and compile the statistics.

**Player Name:** Player24

**Commentary Snippets:**

*   Player24(Away Team) commits a foul, resulting in Player10(Home Team) winning a free kick in the attacking half, This leads to a set piece opportunity for the attacking team.
*   Player24(Away Team) receives a yellow card for a rough tackle.
*   Player24(Away Team) earns a free kick in their own half.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Fouls:** The first snippet states "Player24(Away Team) commits a foul...". This is a clear indication of a foul committed by Player24, so we increment the Fouls count by 1.
2.  **Yellow Cards:** The second snippet states "Player24(Away Team) receives a yellow card...". This clearly indicates a yellow card for Player24, so we increment the Yellow Cards count by 1.
3.  **Free Kicks:** The first snippet states "Player24(Away Team) commits a foul, resulting in Player10(Home Team) winning a free kick". This does not mean Player24 took a free kick, but rather Player24 conceded one. Therefore, this does not increase the Free Kicks count. The third snippet states "Player24(Away Team) earns a free kick in their own half.". This means Player24 either was fouled, or won the ball, either way, earning their team a free kick to take. This means we increment the Free Kicks count by 1.
4.  **Shots, Goals, Assists, Red Cards, Offsides:** None of the snippets explicitly mention Player24 taking a shot, scoring a goal, providing an assist, receiving a red card, or being offside. Therefore, these counts remain at 0.
