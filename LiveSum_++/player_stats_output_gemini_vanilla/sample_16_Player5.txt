1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player5.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Analyze Snippets:**

    *   Snippet 1: "Player5(Home Team) commits a foul." - This explicitly states Player5 committed a foul. Increment Fouls. Fouls = 1.
    *   Snippet 2: "Player5(Home Team) commits a foul." - This explicitly states Player5 committed a foul. Increment Fouls. Fouls = 2.
    *   Snippet 3: "Player5(Home Team) from the Home Team attempts a through ball, but Player6(Home Team) is caught in an offside position." - This mentions Player5 attempting a through ball but Player6 is caught offside, This does not count as a shot, goal, assist or free kick for Player5. Increment Offsides for Player5 to 0.
