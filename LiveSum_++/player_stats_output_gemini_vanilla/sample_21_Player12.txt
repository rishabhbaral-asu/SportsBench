Okay, I will analyze the provided commentary snippets for Player12 and generate the requested markdown table.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player12.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

*   Shots: 0
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player12(Home Team) attempts a through ball, but Player11(Home Team) is offside."
    *   This snippet implies that Player12 attempted a pass, but it does not explicitly state that this pass led to a goal or an attempt on goal. Therefore, no event counts are updated here. Player11 is offside, not Player12.

*   **Snippet 2:** "Player12(Home Team)'s left footed shot from outside the box was saved in the bottom right corner with an assist from Player13(Home Team)."
    *   "shot" is explicitly mentioned, so Shots = 1.
    *   It also does not explicitly say that Player12 scored a goal, therefore Goals = 0.
    *   An assist was provided *to* Player12 from Player13, which does not count as an assist *for* Player12, so Assists = 0.

*   **Snippet 3:** "Player12(Home Team)'s attempt from outside the box is blocked with the help of Player3(Home Team)."
    *   The word "attempt" is used which counts as a shot, so Shots = 2.
    *   It does not explicitly say that Player12 scored a goal, therefore Goals = 0.
    *   Blocked shots don't count for assists. Player3 helped block Player12's shot.

**4. Final Counts:**

*   Shots: 2
*   Goals: 0
*   Assists: 0
*   Free Kicks: 0
*   Fouls: 0
*   Yellow Cards: 0
*   Red Cards: 0
*   Offsides: 0
