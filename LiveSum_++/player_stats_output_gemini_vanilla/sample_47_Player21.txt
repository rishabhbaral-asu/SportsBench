    *   Fouls: 0

3.  **Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

    *   Snippet 1: "Player21(Away Team) attempts a through ball to Player29(Away Team) from a corner kick."
        *   This snippet mentions Player21 attempting a through ball. This does not fall under any specific keyword.
        *   There's no explicit mention of a shot, goal, assist, free kick, foul, or card.

    *   Snippet 2: "Player21(Away Team)'s left footed shot from outside the box, assisted by Player26(Away Team), is blocked after the Away Team obtains a corner kick."
        *   This snippet explicitly states "Player21's left footed shot". Therefore, Shots count is incremented by 1.
        *   The shot was blocked, so there's no goal.
        *   The snippet mentions that Player21 was *assisted by* Player26. Thus Player21 does not get an assist.
