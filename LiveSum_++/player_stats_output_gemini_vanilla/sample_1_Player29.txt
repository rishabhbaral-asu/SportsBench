Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for Player29 and generate the summary table.

**Player Name:** Player29

**Commentary Snippets:**
- Player29(Away Team)'s shot from outside the box is saved in the bottom left corner with the help of Player26(Away Team).

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Shots:** The snippet states "Player29(Away Team)'s shot from outside the box is saved...". This clearly indicates Player29 took a shot. Increment Shots count to 1.
2.  **Goals:** The snippet does not explicitly mention Player29 scoring a goal.
3.  **Assists:** The snippet says the shot was saved "with the help of Player26". This does not indicate that Player29 provided an assist. Player26 helped Player29, not the other way round.

6.  **Yellow Cards:** The snippet does not explicitly mention Player29 receiving a yellow card.
7.  **Red Cards:** The snippet does not explicitly mention Player29 receiving a red card.
