Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the final summary table.

**Objective:** Analyze commentary snippets for a specific player and count explicit occurrences of defined events for that player.

**Input:**
* **Player Name:**
```text
<PLAYER_NAME>
Player2
</PLAYER_NAME>
```
* **Commentary Snippets:**
```text
<PLAYER_COMMENTARY_SNIPPETS>
- Player2(Home Team) has earned a free kick in their own half.
- Player2(Home Team) commits a foul and Player29(Away Team) is awarded a free kick in their own defensive half.
</PLAYER_COMMENTARY_SNIPPETS>
```

1.  **Player Name:** The target player is Player2.
2.  **Initialize Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 0, Fouls = 0, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.
3.  **Analyze Snippets:**
    *   Snippet 1: "Player2(Home Team) has earned a free kick in their own half."
        *   This indicates Player2 has earned a free kick (taken). Increment Free Kicks by 1. Free Kicks = 1
    *   Snippet 2: "Player2(Home Team) commits a foul and Player29(Away Team) is awarded a free kick in their own defensive half."
        *   This indicates Player2 committed a foul. Increment Fouls by 1. Fouls = 1

4.  **Final Counts:** Shots = 0, Goals = 0, Assists = 0, Free Kicks = 1, Fouls = 1, Yellow Cards = 0, Red Cards = 0, Offsides = 0.

Final Summary Table:
