Okay, let's analyze the commentary snippets for Player4 and compile the statistics.

**1. Player Name:**
The target player is Player4.

**2. Initialization:**
We initialize all counts to 0 for Player4.

**3. Snippet Analysis:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player4(Home Team) committed a hand ball."
    *   This explicitly states Player4 committed a hand ball, which is a foul.
    *   Fouls: 1

*   **Snippet 2:** "Player4(Home Team) attempts a shot from outside the box with their right foot, but narrowly misses the top right corner with an assist from Player3(Home Team)."
    *   This explicitly states Player4 attempts a shot.
    *   Shots: 1
    *   The snippet explicitly states the Player4 was assisted by Player3. So Player4 does not get an assist count.

*   **Snippet 3:** "Player4(Home Team) and Player29(Away Team) had their shots saved from outside the box, with Player9(Home Team) and Player27(Away Team) providing the assists."
    *   This explicitly states Player4 had their shot saved.

    *   Shots: 3

*   **Snippet 5:** "Player4(Home Team) with a cross off a set piece, The score now stands at Home Team 2, Away Team 0."
    *   This explicitly states Player4 takes the set piece, however, it does not explicitly state an attempt or taking of a free kick, or penalty. It's possible to interpret this as an assist but there is no explicit mention of an assist, or goal. It is also not a free kick.
