Okay, I will follow the instructions to analyze the commentary snippets for the specified player and generate the final summary table.

1.  **Identify the target player:** The target player is Player29.
2.  **Initialize event counts:**
    * Shots = 0
    * Goals = 0
    * Assists = 0
    * Free Kicks = 0
    * Fouls = 0
    * Yellow Cards = 0
    * Red Cards = 0
    * Offsides = 0

3.  **Analyze commentary snippets:**

    *   Snippet 1: "Player29(Away Team) commits a foul."
        *   The snippet explicitly states that Player29 committed a foul.
        *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 1

    *   Snippet 2: "Player29(Away Team)'s shot from the left side of the box is blocked."
        *   The snippet explicitly states that Player29 took a shot.
        *   Increment Shots: Shots = 1

    *   Snippet 3: "Player29(Away Team) misses the goal with a right-footed shot from outside the box after a corner."
        *   The snippet explicitly states that Player29 took a shot.
        *   Increment Shots: Shots = 2

4.  **Compile the final counts:**
    * Shots = 2
    * Goals = 0
    * Assists = 0
    * Free Kicks = 0
    * Fouls = 1
    * Yellow Cards = 0
    * Red Cards = 0
    * Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
