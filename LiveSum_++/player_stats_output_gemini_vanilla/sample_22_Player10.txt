Okay, let's break down the task. I need to analyze the commentary snippets, identify mentions of "Player10", and count the occurrences of specific soccer events (Shots, Goals, Assists, Free Kicks, Fouls, Yellow Cards, Red Cards, Offsides) that are explicitly attributed to Player10. I will use the provided keywords to identify these events and increment the respective counts. I will adhere strictly to the provided definitions and instructions.

Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. **Player Name:** The target player is Player10.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Shots = 0
   - Goals = 0
   - Assists = 0
   - Free Kicks = 0
   - Fouls = 0
   - Yellow Cards = 0
   - Red Cards = 0
   - Offsides = 0

3. **Snippet Analysis:**

   - **Snippet 1:** "Player10(Home Team)'s shot from the right side of the box is blocked after a through ball from Player8(Home Team)."
     - Contains "shot". Player10 is explicitly performing the action.
     - Increment Shots: Shots = 1

   - **Snippet 2:** "Player10(Home Team)'s left footed shot from outside the box is blocked."
     - Contains "shot". Player10 is explicitly performing the action.
     - Increment Shots: Shots = 2

   - **Snippet 3:** "Player10(Home Team) commits a foul."
     - Contains "foul". Player10 is explicitly performing the action.
     - Increment Fouls: Fouls = 1

4. **Final Counts:**
   - Shots = 2
   - Goals = 0
   - Assists = 0
   - Free Kicks = 0
   - Fouls = 1
   - Yellow Cards = 0
   - Red Cards = 0
   - Offsides = 0

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player10 | 2     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 1     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
