Okay, let's start by identifying the target player and initializing the counts for all event types.

**1. Identify Target Player:**

The target player is Player28.

**2. Initialize Counts:**

Shots: 0
Goals: 0
Assists: 0
Free Kicks: 0
Fouls: 0
Yellow Cards: 0
Red Cards: 0
Offsides: 0

**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player28(Away Team) earns a free kick in their own half."

    *   This explicitly states Player28 earned a free kick. This means Player28 was fouled or won a free kick, so Free Kicks + 1.
    *   Shots: 0, Goals: 0, Assists: 0, Free Kicks: 1, Fouls: 0, Yellow Cards: 0, Red Cards: 0, Offsides: 0

*   **Snippet 2:** "Player28(Away Team) scores with a left-footed shot from the center of the box, assisted by Player29(Away Team), The score is now Home Team 0, Away Team 1."

    *   This explicitly states Player28 scored a goal, which means both Goals + 1 and Shots + 1. The mention of being "assisted by Player29" does *not* contribute to assists for Player28.
    *   Shots: 1, Goals: 1, Assists: 0, Free Kicks: 1, Fouls: 0, Yellow Cards: 0, Red Cards: 0, Offsides: 0

*   **Snippet 3:** "Player28(Away Team) scores with a right-footed shot from the center of the box, putting the Away Team ahead 2-0 against the Home Team."

    *   This explicitly states Player28 scored a goal, which means both Goals + 1 and Shots + 1.
    *   Shots: 2, Goals: 2, Assists: 0, Free Kicks: 1, Fouls: 0, Yellow Cards: 0, Red Cards: 0, Offsides: 0
