**3. Analyze Commentary Snippets:**

*   **Snippet 1:** "Player6(Home Team) attempts a through ball, but Player9(Home Team) is called offside." - This does not fit any of the categories. Player6 attempts a pass but it results in Player9 being offside; this doesn't count as an assist.
*   **Snippet 2:** "Player6(Home Team)'s close-range header is blocked after a cross from Player7(Home Team)." - Player6 has a header that is blocked. Blocked shots count as shots. Shots = 1.
*   **Snippet 3:** "Player6(Home Team)'s left footed shot from the left side of the box is blocked, resulting in a corner kick for the Home Team." - Player6 has a shot that is blocked. Shots = 2.
*   **Snippet 4:** "Player6(Home Team) earns a free kick in their own half." - Player6 earns a free kick. Free Kicks = 1
*   **Snippet 5:** "Player6(Home Team) was delayed due to injury but now the delay is over and they are ready to continue." - This snippet doesn't fit any category.

*   **Snippet 7:** "Player6(Home Team) receives a yellow card for a rough challenge." - Player6 receives a yellow card. Yellow Cards = 1.

**4. Final Counts:**
