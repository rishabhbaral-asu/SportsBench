Okay, let's start by identifying the player name and initializing the counts.

Initial Counts:
Shots: 0
Goals: 0
Assists: 0
Free Kicks: 0
Fouls: 0
Yellow Cards: 0

Offsides: 0

Now, let's analyze each commentary snippet and increment the counts accordingly.

Snippet 1: "Player8(Home Team)'s shot from outside the box is saved in the bottom right corner."
- Player8 is explicitly mentioned taking a shot.
- Shots: 0 + 1 = 1

Snippet 2: "Player8(Home Team)'s shot from the center of the box, assisted by Player4(Home Team), goes over the crossbar."
- Player8 is explicitly mentioned taking a shot.
- Shots: 1 + 1 = 2
- Player8 was assisted by Player4, therefore Player8 does not have an assist.

Snippet 3: "Player8(Home Team)'s shot from the left side was blocked with the help of Player9(Home Team)."
- Player8 is explicitly mentioned taking a shot.
- Shots: 2 + 1 = 3

Final Counts:
Shots: 3
Goals: 0
Assists: 0
Free Kicks: 0
Fouls: 0
Yellow Cards: 0
Red Cards: 0
Offsides: 0
