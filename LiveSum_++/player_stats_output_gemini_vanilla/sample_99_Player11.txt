Okay, let's break down the process step by step to analyze the commentary snippets and generate the player statistics table.

1.  **Identify Target Player:** The target player is Player11.

2.  **Initialize Counts:**
    *   Shots = 0
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 0
    *   Fouls = 0
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0

3.  **Analyze Snippets:**

    *   **Snippet 1: "Player11(Home Team) commits a foul."**
        *   The snippet explicitly states that Player11 committed a foul.
        *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 1

    *   **Snippet 2: "Player11(Home Team) fouls Player25(Away Team), who is awarded a free kick in their own defensive half."**
        *   The snippet explicitly states that Player11 committed a foul.
        *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 2

4.  **Compile Final Counts:**
    *   Shots = 0
    *   Goals = 0
    *   Assists = 0
    *   Free Kicks = 0
    *   Fouls = 2
    *   Yellow Cards = 0
    *   Red Cards = 0
    *   Offsides = 0

5.  **Create Final Summary Table:**

Final Summary Table:
```markdown
| Player   | Shots | Goals | Assists | Free Kicks | Fouls | Yellow Cards | Red Cards | Offsides |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Player11 | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0          | 2     | 0            | 0         | 0        |
```
