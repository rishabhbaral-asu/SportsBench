Okay, let's break this down step-by-step.

1. **Identify Target Player:**
   The target player is Player22.

2. **Initialize Counts:**
   Shots = 0
   Goals = 0
   Assists = 0
   Free Kicks = 0
   Fouls = 0
   Yellow Cards = 0
   Red Cards = 0
   Offsides = 0

3. **Analyze Snippets:**

   *   **Snippet 1:** "Player22(Away Team) commits a foul."
        *   This explicitly states Player22 committed a foul.
        *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 1

   *   **Snippet 2:** "Player22(Away Team) scores with a right-footed shot from the right side of the box, putting the Home Team on the scoreboard with 1 goal against the Away Team's 2."
        *   This explicitly states Player22 scored a goal.
        *   Increment Goals: Goals = 1
        *   Increment Shots: Shots = 1

   *   **Snippet 3:** "Player22(Away Team) commits a foul, resulting in Player3(Home Team) winning a free kick in their own defensive half, The foul by Player22(Away Team) gives Player3(Home Team) a free kick in their own defensive half."
        *   This explicitly states Player22 committed a foul.
        *   Increment Fouls: Fouls = 2

4. **Compile Final Counts:**
   Shots = 1
   Goals = 1
   Assists = 0
   Free Kicks = 0
   Fouls = 2
   Yellow Cards = 0
   Red Cards = 0
   Offsides = 0
